Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
In 2021, the progress made in vaccination allowed the economic recovery to take hold (adjusting its speed as new strains appeared) and allayed fears of significant structural damage.
However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, economies around the world were significantly affected by the imposition of trade sanctions targeting Russian individuals, companies and institutions, triggering a significant reduction in trade between the West and Russia, pushing up prices in global markets for commodities such as oil, natural gas and wheat, and causing inflationary pressures, bottlenecks in the supply chain and volatility in the financial and commodity markets. lFor more information on the risks and uncertainty arising from the war, see section 7.5 Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Recent economic trends
The global economy had finished 2021 showing high growth (world GDP grew by 6.0% in the year as a whole), in a context of recovery after the enormous shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the economic environment has had to face serious and new challenges since the beginning of 2022, marked by the confluence of three adverse forces: i) greater geopolitical tensions and rising raw material prices, both as a result of the war in Ukraine; ii) the slowdown in China due to a real estate crisis and closures of companies and factories under the “zero COVID” policy; iii) higher inflation, aggravated by the two previous factors, causing a cost-of-living crisis (as income and spending in real terms contract) and a strong response from central banks, which have rapidly tightened average Henry Hub price in 2022 financial conditions in a synchronized manner, accompanied by an appreciation of the dollar. This last factor is especially unfavorable to the growth of emerging countries, since a stronger dollar pushes up import prices and leads to a higher cost of servicing their hard-currency-denominated debt.

Monetary policy is being tightened much more firmly than expected at the beginning of the year. Indeed, the US Federal Reserve, which began the tightening cycle in March when it raised reference rates from 0% to 0.25%, finally brought rates up to 4.25% at the end of the year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) abandoned its negative policy rates in July and ended the year with reference rates at 2.5%.

According to the latest forecasts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF, World Economic Outlook January 2023), growth of 3.4% is expected in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023, but these forecasts appear overly optimistic and the risks to growth are skewed to the downside.
Regarding the exchange rate, the environment of high uncertainty and high liquidity needs in the first months of the pandemic intensified appreciation of the dollar, which

reached levels of 1.078 dollars/euro at the beginning of April 2020. However, subsequently the dollar tended to depreciate, especially against the euro, falling to levels of 1.22 dollars/euro at the beginning of 2021. This was because the reduction in risk aversion meant that the interest rate differential and the fundamentals became more significant when determining the exchange rate. But, starting in the last quarter of 2021, better progress in the United States' economic recovery, together with greater upward risks in inflation, led to a new appreciation of the dollar against the euro, which was intensified by greater speed and decision in the Fed's monetary tightening. The price reached 0.96 dollars/euro at the end of September, but more recently this trend has reversed somewhat, returning to a level of 1.06 dollars/euro in December. The average for 2022 was 1.05 dollars/euro.

Crude oil – Brent
Benchmark Brent crude oil went from trading at around 75 $/ bbl at the end of 2021 to reach levels of 139 $/bbl in March. On February 23, one day before Russia invaded Ukraine, the Brent price was 96.8 $/bbl. After the invasion, prices skyrocketed, the Brent barrel increasing by more than 20% in ten days and reaching levels not seen since 2008.
In 2022, the price of a barrel of Brent crude averaged 101.3 $/ bbl, almost 40% more than in 2021, although prices fell significantly in the second half of the year. The war in Ukraine has been a determining factor in prices, because of the direct sanctions imposed by some governments on importing Russian oil, and because of self-imposed embargoes by companies that previously imported crude oil and oil products from Russia. But the war was not the only factor to explain the rise in prices: the advances made last year in the vaccination processes and the progressive end of confinements had already supported economic development and mobility, resulting in increased demand for crude oil and oil products. Additionally, this solid demand for oil met with a short-term supply controlled by the OPEC+ group, and determined in the medium/long term by low investment in recent years. The result was a tight balance in the oil markets, increased by indirect factors such as the sharp increase in natural gas prices at the end of 2021 , which had a positive effect on the demand for oil for use, instead of natural gas, in electricity generation.

In principle, the most obvious impact of the war in Ukraine on the oil markets has to do with shorter supply. To give an idea of the importance of Russia in global energy markets, note that it is the third largest oil producer in the world, after the United States and Saudi Arabia (in January 2022, it produced 11.3 mb/d of petroleum, 10 mbbl/d of crude, 0.96 mbbl/d of condensates and 0.34 mbbl/d of natural gas liquids) and the world's largest exporter of oil to global markets (in December 2021 , it exported 7.8 mbbl/d, comprising 5 mbbl/d (64%) of crude oil and condensates and 2.8 mbbl/d of oil products, mainly made up of 1.1 mbbl/ d of diesel, 650 kbbl/d of fuel oil, 500 kbbl/d of naphtha and 280 kbbl/d of vacuum gasoil).
To reduce its dependency, the European Union imposed an embargo on the import of Russian crude oil by ship from December 5 and on the import of petroleum products as of February 5, 2023. The effect of this decision on prices is uncertain, although some analysts point to an environment of high prices in 2023. Any future sanctions in addition to those already implemented would create upside price risks.
The announcement of a 2 mb/d cut in production by the OPEC+ group adds even more uncertainty and volatility to the oil markets. The agreement provides for a reduction of 2 mb/d in its production from November 2022 to December 2023. However, it is estimated that the real and effective cut in the group's production will be in the range of 1 mb/d to 0.8 mb/d, as some members were already producing below their own quota. Nigeria and Angola stand out among the countries facing serious problems in increasing their production. In the first case, Nigeria's production has been affected by temporary problems, such as technical issues and interruptions, while Angola's production has been hampered by structural problems due to lack of investment and the decline of its most productive blocks. Regarding Russia, the general consensus points to a drop in its production in the range of 0.9 mb/d -1.4 mb/d in 2023. This would lead Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to bear the brunt of the cuts. Saudi Arabia could cut production by up to 520 kb/d, Iraq by 220 kb/d and the UAE by 160 kb/d.

Natural Gas - Henry Hub (HH)
In 2022 the Henry Hub price of US natural gas averaged 6.6 $/MBtu, well above the price in 2021 (3.9 $/MBtu), and occasionally climbing above 9 $/MBtu, setting all-time highs for the year. This increase in the price of gas was largely down to the dynamics of the domestic market. Demand remained high due partly to the boost in consumption in the residential, commercial and power generation sectors, and partly to the high exports of LNG, which regularly exceeded 13 Bcf/d for much of the second quarter of 2022. On the supply side, the maintenance of high production levels, especially in the third quarter of 2022, with levels around 100 Bcf/d, together with the slowdown in exports from the Freeport LNG terminal, acted as brakes on further potential price increases in the last months of the year. The high production volumes allowed inventories to be filled rapidly, which also helped to contain prices.

Additionally, the situation in the gas market after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine kept global market uncertainty and price volatility high. The need for gas in Europe and Asia secures the market niche for LNG coming from the United States, which should keep prices high in the short term.
Electricity prices
The average wholesale price of electricity in 2022 was 167.7 €/MWh, well above the 111.4 €/MWh for the same period in the previous year.This price would have to have added to it the adjustment applied to consumers in the market following implementation of the electricity price adjustment mechanism (known as the gas “cap”), which would give an effective average of close to 210 €/MWh.
This mechanism has caused combined-cycle plants to become more profitable. This means that some that were barely used before have been started up, boosting the consumption of gas for electricity generation despite its price. Meanwhile, the reduction in prices due to this mechanism has also caused a price differential with the French market. This has led to a shift in the direction of the interconnection, which has become a net exporter to France.
The increase in generation through combined cycle plants and exports was accompanied by notably lower hydro power generation in Spain during the period, due to the drought, and a sharp increase in photovoltaic generation (with changes of -45% and +33% respectively).
The lower operation of cogeneration plants is also very significant, affected at first by their being excluded for several months from the adjustment mechanism for consumers, meaning that their market share was absorbed by combined cycles, but also by lower industrial activity.
In the last few months of the year, a more favorable climate for renewables and somewhat more moderate gas prices allowed electricity prices to fall from the high figures reported in the summer, to a maximum hourly price of 700 €/MWh and a daily maximum of 545 €/MWh.
It should be noted that the increases in photovoltaic capacity implemented in recent months have not only led to new generation maximums being recorded, but have also to a change in the daily price profile, so that the lowest prices now occur in the early hours of the afternoon, instead of in the early morning, as was usual in the past.

CO emission allowances
The price of CO2 emission allowances fluctuated significantly during 2022, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the economic climate. This uncertainty has caused a spread of 30 €/t in prices, which averaged 81.3 €/t in 2022, well above the 53.3 €/t traded at in the same period of 2021.
Despite the fuel price situation and lower security of supply, the European Union has made it clear that decarbonization is a priority objective, and this has continued to support prices. In late 2022, the European Council, the Parliament and the Commission provisionally agreed to increase to 62% the emission reduction to be reached by 2030 in the sectors covered by this regime (adapting to the new target of reducing CO2 emissions by 55% in the European economy as a whole by 2030 compared to 1990 – Fit for 55). Another factor driving up emissions prices is the forecast of more coal-fired generation in countries that may have less gas supplied from Russia, especially Germany.

Net income
The results for 2022 are affected by the complex geopolitical, macroeconomic and global energy context.
The improved results reflect the advantage taken of the opportunities offered by the current environment to some of our businesses (recovery in demand for fuels due to fewer restrictions on mobility, increase in crude oil and gas prices, improvement in the international refining margin), thanks to the company’s strong industrial investment policy in previous years and its optimization of the international portfolio of oil and gas Upstream assets undertaken in the previous environment of very low prices.
Conversely, the discounts applied at service stations to mitigate the effects of the war and the tightening of future conditions for the activity of our businesses, notably increased regulatory and fiscal pressure, have had a negative impact on the results and prompted the recognition of impairment losses, mainly at the Refining Spain business.
Adjusted net income for the period amounted to €6,661 million, 171% higher than in the previous year, driven by the notable performance of the Refining and Trading businesses (high margins), Upstream (increased prices and efficiency measures deployed) and Renewables and Low Carbon Generation (high prices and higher production), and to a lesser extent, due to the positive impact of the treasury stock position and lower interest on the financial result.
With the inventory effect (€75 million) and special items (€-2,485 million, mainly impairment on Refining assets), net income amounted to €4,251 million.
Recovering prices at Upstream and margins at Industrial businesses, coupled with increased sales at the Commercial businesses, combined to push up EBITDA significantly in the period to €13,813 million (vs. €8,170 million in 2021).

Upstream
Average production for the period was -4% down on 2021 (at 550 Kboe/d) and investment increased in both development and exploration. l For more information on the activities in the segment, see section 5.1 Upstream
Adjusted net income at Upstream amounted to €3,029 million, up €1,342 million on 2021.
The improvement in results is explained by the positive impact of higher realization prices for crude oil (+44%) and gas(+61%), which significantly boosted the results obtained in the United States, Norway, Trinidad and Tobago, Libya, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Peru, and by the appreciation of the dollar.
These positive impacts were partially offset by:
• a lower volume of sales compared to the previous year. Aside from the natural decline of fields, in Libya there were interruptions (over safety concerns and maintenance requirements); divestment of assets (Canada and Algeria); and operational incidents (Brazil). All this, despite the increase in production in the United States (new wells and investments at Eagle Ford and Marcellus) and in Peru (less maintenance and fewer incidents than in 2021);
• higher taxes on production and hydrocarbon royalties, in line with the rise in prices; as well as higher income tax (effective rate of 47%; 45% in 2021), in line with the improvement in results;
• higher production costs due to, among others, the start-up of strategic projects (YME in Norway), new investments and wells in the United States (Marcellus and Eagle Ford), maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico (Shenzi), and the increased cost of transport (Brazil) and CO2 allowances (United Kingdom);
• increased expenses in exploration due to a more intense exploration campaign than in 2021, and optimization of the portfolio;

• no further results reported for the countries in which Repsol sold its interests (Malaysia, Ecuador, Vietnam and Russia).
Investments (€2,127 million) was up on 2021 (+74%) due to an increase in drilling activity in the United States and the acquisition of new assets at Marcellus. Investment activity centered on assets in production and/or under development in the United States, Trinidad and Tobago, Norway, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Exploratory investment during the period centered on Gulf of Mexico (United States and Mexico), Indonesia, Guyana and Colombia.
Industrial
Adjusted net income amounted to €3,150 million in 2022, compared to €606 million in 2021. The main reasons for this change are as follows:
• The Refining businesses, which in the previous year obtained losses, improved their results by €2,806 million in an environment of very high international margins – impacted by the shortage of gasoil in Europe – and tensions along the supply chain that have increased sales in the domestic market. This improvement has been partially offset by higher costs for energy and CO2 allowances.
• At Chemicals, the results were down by €490 million, mainly reflecting the drop in international margins (extraordinarily high in 2021, while in 2022 they were negatively impacted by higher naphtha prices and energy costs) and lower sales due to lower demand, mainly in the second half of the year.
• Trading and Wholesale and Gas Trading saw an improvement of €76 million in their results compared to the previous year, mainly at Trading (across almost all business lines, but notably in operations in the international crude oil, heavy crude and gasoil markets). Worse performance at Wholesale and Gas Trading amid high prices for natural gas and considerable market volatility.
Investment in 2022 amounted to €1,025 million, up 19% on 2021, mainly due to the purchase of 14% of the Canadian company Enerkem and an increase in investment in refineries. The investments were mainly in maintaining and improving levels of activity at industrial complexes and in starting up major decarbonization investments and projects. l For more information on the segment's activities, see section 5.2 Industrial
Commercial and Renewables
Adjusted net income in 2022 came to €540 million, in line with that of 2021. The impact of the discounts applied at service stations in Spain was offset by the improvement at the other commercial businesses and at Renewables:
Integrated Management Report 2022
2 Our Company
3 Environment
4 Financial performance and shareholder remuneration

5 Performance of our businesses
• Results at the Mobility businesses were down due to declining margins at service stations in Spain, a consequence of the more than €500 million in additional discounts applied to cushion the effects of the war. This negative impact was partially offset by the increase in volumes sold following the progressive easing of mobility restrictions and by the higher discounts.
• Earnings also improved at LPG, driven by higher margins on price-regulated operations in Spain, despite lower volumes sold in bottled products (due to higher temperatures), offset by an increase in bulk sales to industry and the services sector.
• Earnings were up at Lubricants, Aviation, Asphalts and Specialized Products, due to increased margins in Specialized Products, Lubricants and Asphalts and increased business volumes in Aviation.
• Slight improvement in results at Retail Electricity and Gas, albeit negative in both periods due to higher commercial costs and the negative impact of high volatility in gas and electricity prices in the Spanish pool (see section 3.2), which was not passed on to customers. All of this was mitigated by the higher volumes sold, both of electricity and gas, and by the higher number of customers (+10.3%, exceeding 1.4 million).
• At Renewables and Low Carbon Generation, earnings were higher than in 2021, due to the favorable price environment, increased production from combined cycles and the commissioning of new solar facilities in Spain and the United States.
Investments in 2022 totaled €925 million, mainly in the expansion of renewables in the United States (Frye Solar, Outpost and Jicarilla), and for the development and commissioning of new renewable facilities in Spain (Delta II and Sigma). They were up 12% on 2021, which included the acquisition of 40% of the US company Hecate Energy Group, LLC. and contributions for the development of projects in Chile (through the joint venture with Ibereólica). lFor more information on the segment’s activities, see section 5.3 Commercial and Renewables.
Corporate and others
Earnings for 2022 amounted to €-58 million (vs. €-381 million in 2021). This change is largely down to an improved financial result, which was positively impacted by higher earnings from treasury stock positions and interest rates, lower interest on debt, and higher remuneration from investments due to the robust financial position (debt reduction of 61%) and high liquidity.
At Corporate, further efforts were made to reduce corporate costs, with results in line with those reported in 2021, while continuing to focus on digitalization and technology initiatives.

• The positive inventory effect of €75 million, compared with €797 million in 2021.The impact of the rise in the prices of crude oil and petroleum products in the first half of the year was almost completely countered by the negative price trend in the second half of the year.
• Special items in 2022 came to €-2,485 million, relating mainly to impairment at the Industrial businesses and, to a lesser extent, provisions for credit risk (Venezuela), taxes on extraordinary income in the United Kingdom and the spill in Peru, partially offset by the recognition of tax credits.

Provisions and others(1)
TOTAL (1) Includes mainly provisions for credit risk in Venezuela, legal, tax and environmental litigation, as well as extraordinary income tax in the United Kingdom.
Turning to asset impairment, the main instances of impairment related to certain Refining assets in Spain. Medium and long-term expectations have been downgraded as a result of the new European measures to accelerate the energy transition, the increase in taxes and the negative impact (beyond the short term) of market dynamics driven by the war. These new circumstances will affect the profitability and competitiveness of some facilities and have led to provisions being recognized for impairment and dismantling of those units that would be more difficult to adapt in response to an accelerated energy transition and decarbonization process. The impact on results was -€1,479 million (-€1,247 million after tax). For more information on impairment, see Note 20 – Asset impairment to the 2022 consolidated financial statements.
As a result of all the foregoing, the net income of the Group in 2022 was €4,251 million, compared to €2,499 million reported in 2021, with significant improvements in the profitability indicators:

Cash flow from operations (€8,923 million) was much higher than the figure reported in 2021, due to a significant increase in EBITDA in almost all businesses except for Chemicals and Mobility. This positive impact was partially offset by the higher taxes paid (Upstream and Refining performance) and by the negative impact of the higher cost of inventories (prices and volumes) and the acquisition of CO2 allowances.
The increase in investments, compared to the previous year (+53%), resulted in lower cash flow from investing activities (€-3,712 million). Among the investments in 2022, those that stand out correspond to the Upstream segment (especially those made in the United States, including the disbursement for the acquisition of Rockdale in Marcellus) and to the Industrial segment (maintenance and improvement of the activities of the industrial complexes, start-up of decarbonization projects and purchase of 14% of Enerkem), as well as the commitments in Renewables to continue the international expansion in the United States and the development of projects in Spain. On the divestments side, highlights at Upstream included the cash released from the sale of assets in Canada and the divestments made in Malaysia and Russia.
Free cash flow amounted to €5,211 million, much higher than the €2,839 reported in 2021. In addition to this free cash flow, we have the cash obtained from the sale of 25% of Repsol Renovables and 49% of the Valdesolar and Kappa facilities without loss of control (transaction with non- controlling interests) (€1,130 million in total). Cash generated in 2022 amounts to €3,228 million, once Repsol has paid the remuneration to its shareholders (higher dividends), perpetual bond holders (-€79 million) and non- controlling interests (-€38 million), and met the cost of acquiring treasury stock (€-1,714 million) and financing and leasing costs (€-397 million). This cash generation is considerably higher than the €1,293 million reported in 2021.

4.3 Financial position
In 2022, in line with the commitment to strengthen the Group's financial structure, the various measures that have allowed solid levels of debt and low leverage to be achieved were continued.
In keeping with our policy of financial prudence and our pledge to maintain a high degree of liquidity, cash and cash equivalents held by the Group at the end of the year (in the form of cash and available credit facilities) were sufficient to cover debt maturities until the second quarter of 2033, without the need for refinancing, thus allowing us to flows and divestments comfortably operate through the prevailing volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets impacted by the war in Ukraine.

5 Performance of our businesses
Indebtedness
Net debt (€2,256 million) was down compared to December 2021, mainly due to increased cash flow from operations (driven by a significant improvement in EBITDA) and, to a lesser extent, to the cash obtained from divestments and sales of non-controlling stakes.
Dividends and Treasury shares
Gross debt amounted to €(12,537) million. Its maturity at December 31, 2022 is broken down on the next page.

1 2022 Overview
Main financing transactions
In 2022 the main financial transactions were as follows:
• In May, a Repsol International Finance, B.V. bond issue for a nominal amount of €500 million and a fixed annual coupon of 0.5% was redeemed at maturity.

Sustainable financing framework
In June 2021, a new comprehensive sustainable financing strategy was released to accompany the energy transition process, offering flexibility and transparency in the issuance of financial instruments. It is implemented through a framework (available at www.repsol.com), which was updated in March 2022 with the new transition path published on Low Carbon Day and incorporates both instruments for the financing of specific projects (green and transitional) and instruments linked to sustainable company commitments (Sustainability-Linked Bonds, or SLBs).
Liquidity
Group liquidity at December 31, 2022, including committed and undrawn credit facilities, stood at €12,014 million, which is enough to cover its short-term debt maturities by a factor of 4.01. Repsol had undrawn credit facilities amounting to €2,681 million and €2,675 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In 2022, Repsol maintained its investment grade rating, with both Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s upgrading their rating by one notch to Baa1 and BBB+ respectively, both with stable outlook.
4.4 Shareholder remuneration
Repsol does not have a formal policy on dividends, and the Company's decisions on shareholder return depend on several factors, including the performance of its businesses and its operating results.
The cash remuneration received by shareholders in 20221 was 0.63 €/share, which included:
• a dividend of €0.30 gross per share paid in January,
• a dividend of €0.33 gross per share paid out in July
Additionally, in May3, October4 and December5 three capital reductions have been carried out, through the redemption, in each of the first two, of 75 million treasury shares and of 50 million shares in the third (a total of 200 million shares redeemed), which contributed to shareholder remuneration by increasing earnings per share.
Shareholder remuneration in 2023
In January 2023, shareholders were remunerated with €0.35 gross per share through the distribution of: (i) €0.325 gross per share paid out against voluntary reserves6; and (ii) a dividend of €0.025 gross per share paid out against 2022 earnings. The total amount paid out came to €454 million.7 charged to voluntary reserves from retained earnings, for a total of €4392 million;
In October the Board of Directors agreed to submit for the approval of shareholders, at the next Annual General Meeting to be held in 2023, a final dividend of €0.35 gross per share. Consequently, if the above-mentioned proposal is approved by the 2023 General Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders will receive a cash remuneration of €0.70 gross per share in 2023 (11% higher than in 2022).
Lastly, in February 2023, the Board of Directors agreed to launch a share buyback program targeting a maximum of 35 million treasury shares and to propose to the next Annual General Meeting a capital reduction through the redemption of 50 million treasury shares.
against 2021 earnings, for a total amount of €4713 million.

1 2022 Overview
Information on oil and gas exploration and production activities
To coincide with the publication of this Management Report, Repsol publishes "Information on oil and gas exploration and production activities" on www.repsol.com, to provide detailed information on acreage, exploration and development activity, net proven reserves, future cash flows, production, and other useful information.

Main events
Repsol considers its Upstream business, including its long- term maintenance and consolidation, to be strategic. In the context of dynamic permanent management of the business portfolio, various opportunities were analyzed, resulting in the announcement, in September, of an agreement with the United States institutional investor EIG for the sale of a 25% stake.l For more information, see section 2.5 Strategy.
The efficiency measures and greater focus on the value of the portfolio of oil and gas assets, which were implemented in an environment of low prices, have been essential in taking full advantage of profitability in the current cycle of high prices.l For more information, see section 4.1 Results.
Management of the asset portfolio
In 2022, in addition to the agreement for the sale of 25% of the Upstream business, divestments (exiting countries) were completed in Malaysia, Russia, Ecuador and Greece, and various assets in Canada (Duvernay, Chauvin and Montney) were sold.
In order to focus on priority geographic areas, additional investments were completed in Marcellus, with the assets acquired from Rockdale Marcellus LLC and Abarta, and an agreement was announced to acquire new assets at Eagle Ford.
Average production
Average production totaled 550 Kboe/d in 2022, 4% Kboe/d lower than the previous year, mainly due to the sale of production assets in Canada, Algeria (TFT-II) and Norway (Brage) in 2021 and the Repsol Group’s exit from certain countries (Malaysia, Ecuador, Russia and Vietnam), intermittent stoppages in Libya over security concerns and natural decline of the fields and the effect of higher prices on operating contracts in Bolivia. All of this was partially offset by the commissioning of new wells at the non-conventional assets of Marcellus and Eagle Ford in the United States, the entry into production of the YME project in Norway, fewer operating incidents in Peru and Trinidad and Tobago, and higher demand for gas in Venezuela.

In 2022, drilling was completed on eight exploratory wells, two of them positive (both in Colombia) and six negative (two in Colombia and one each in the United States, Bolivia, Guyana and Indonesia); plus three appraisal wells in the United States, two with positive and one with negative results. At December 31, an exploratory survey was under way in Colombia.
Acreage
A final investment decision was made in relation to one project in the US Gulf of Mexico (Castile and Leon), on Phase 3 of development at Eagle Ford in the United States, on Phase I of the Pikka project in Alaska in the United States, on the Lapa project in southeast Brazil, and on the Cypre project in Trinidad and Tobago, to make further progress in strategic projects. In Alaska, unitization of the Quoka area and of the Alignment Agreement area was settled, which meant that Repsol entered with a 49% stake in 46 blocks that belonged 100% to Oil Search.
Reserves
A total of 194 Mboe in proven reserves was added in 2022, mainly a result of extensions and discoveries, reviews and buying and selling. The total reserve Replacement Ratio was 97% in 2022 (130% in 2021).

Main events • United States: expansion at Marcellus and Eagle Ford and final investment decision made on Castile and Leon, and phase three of development at Eagle Ford and Pikka.
In January and February, in the United States, new assets were acquired at Marcellus, adding approximately 45,000 net acres in Tioga, Bradford and Lycoming counties (Pennsylvania), including additional production of approximately 80 million cubic feet per day and future drilling locations.
In February, the stake in Blacktip in the Gulf of Mexico was increased to 11.3%, by absorbing a portion of Chevron’s stake following its exit from the project.
In March, an agreement was signed with the non-profit foundation MiQ (the main market standard for methane emissions performance in the United States) to obtain certification for the Marcellus Shale production in Pennsylvania. The Monument-2 delineation drilling in the Walker Ridge 271 block in the Gulf of Mexico was also completed with a positive result.
In May, the final investment decision (FID) was made to develop the Castille and Leon projects located in the Keathley Canyon extension area of the Gulf of Mexico (partners LLOG and Beacon).
In June, the FID was reached for the third phase of Eagle Ford development, which involves drilling a further 49 operated wells (on 12 platforms) that are expected to generate additional incremental lifetime net sales of 42 Mboe in the retrograde gas, wet gas and black oil windows.
In August, the final investment decision was made for development of Phase I of the Pikka project in Alaska. The project is designed with a carbon intensity index that is among the lowest in the global portfolio of assets. Production is expected to start in 2026. In December, the authorities approved the project.

5 Performance of our businesses
In November, Shell obtained a 20% interest in eight blocks at the Walker Ridge area (blocks 4, 5, 48, 90, 91, 92, 134 and 135) in the Gulf of Mexico, spread between the Shenandoah and Sparta projects. Repsol is a partner of Shell at several prospecting wells in the Shenandoah area, including Abilene. The agreement is subject to regulator approval.
In December, Carbon-Zero, Cox, Crescent Midstream and Repsol joined forces to develop one of the most important marine hubs on the Gulf of Mexico Coast for CCUS (Carbon Capture Usage & Storage).
In December, the acquisition of new acreage was agreed with the company INPEX in the strategic area of Eagle Ford.
• Canada: sale of acreage in Alberta.
In September, 95,000 net acres (38,000 hectares) of the Chauvin, Duvernay and Montney productive oil and gas fields in Alberta were sold to Teine Energy.
• Mexico: return of blocks and restoration of reefs.
In 2022, the National Hydrocarbons Commission authorized the return of exploration blocks 5, 10, 11, 14 and 15, located in the Burgos Basin in the Gulf of Mexico. Following these withdrawals, Repsol’s presence in Mexico is limited to just block 29 in the deep waters of the Salina basin in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is an operator with a 30% stake.
In September, the reef restoration program began in Veracruz. Repsol, together with the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas of Mexico and Blue Tech/ Oceanus, A.C., began a work program for the restoration of three hectares of reef in the Veracruz Reef System National Park. The objectives include increasing healthy and genetically diverse coral colonies and rehabilitating the area’s structure and ecological functions, notably including the need to allow other species and organisms to grow and flourish there.

1 2022 Overview
Main events • Bolivia: increase in production.
Within the framework of the development works in the Caipipendi area, in Bolivia, the milestone of early connection of the MGR-10 Well was reached in June, increasing production by more than 2 Mm3/d ahead of schedule. Drilling of the well in 2021 reached a depth of 4,550 meters. The production test results confirmed the production volumes, which led to the approval of the project, with initial flows of more than 2 Mm3/d and 2,600 boe/d.
• Brazil: seismic acquisition in Albacora Leste and FID in Lapa SW.
In May, Repsol Sinopec Brazil and its partners Petrobras and Equinor began 4D seismic acquisition operations (892 km2) spanning the neighboring Roncador field in the deep waters of the Campos basin.
In January 2023, the final investment decision (FID) was made on the Lapa SW block in the Santos basin. When it goes into operation in 2025, Lapa Sudoeste will increase production from the Lapa field by 25,000 barrels of oil per day.
• Colombia: 2 positive exploratory wells.
In September, the Tejón-1 exploratory well, carried out at the CPO-9 block operated by Ecopetrol (Repsol holding a 45% stake), ended with positive results.
In October, drilling of the Cosecha GN 01 exploratory well in the Cosecha block, operated by SierraCol (with Repsol holding a 17.5% stake), was completed with positive results.
• Ecuador: end of production activity.
In January, the sale to New Stratus Energy of Repsol’s 35% operating interest in heavy crude blocks 16 and 67 was completed.
• Trinidad and Tobago: Installation of the Cassia C platform and start of development of the Cypre project.
In July, Repsol, together with BP, completed installation of the upper part of the Cassia Compression (Cassia C) platform off the east coast of Trinidad. The installation marks an important milestone in the project that will allow access to and production of low-pressure gas reserves from fields currently in production in the Greater Cassia area, thus maximizing the recovery of these existing resources. Production started in November.
In September, Repsol, together with BP, confirmed the start of development of its Cypre offshore gas project (joint development of the SEQB and Macadamia discoveries). At its peak, the development is expected to generate average gas production of 250 to 300 million cubic feet per day (mmscfd).
• Venezuela: improvement of prospects for the operation
While the political and economic situation remains the same, the prospects for the operation have improved as a result of the incipient relaxation of the United States Government’s coercive measures against Venezuela.

Main events in the period • Norway: Blane and Mikkel extension, and dismantling.
In February, the production license for the Blane field was extended until July 8, 2027, and production ceased at the Veslefrikk field (24 wells).
In July, dismantling of the 30,000-ton Gyda platform in Norway was successfully completed.
In November, the Norwegian Petroleum Operations Safety Agency (PSA) approved the use of the Mikkel subsea facilities until December 2039, which translates into a 16- year extension from July 2023. Subsea compression has achieved an increase in recoverable reserves, making this extension necessary.
• United Kingdom: dismantling and Pre-FEED Marigold study.
In April, dismantling of the Buchan and Hannay fields was completed, achieving a recycling rate and a reuse of recovered materials of 99%. New agreements were also signed to export the oil produced at Golden Eagle, Piper and Claymore to the Flotta Repsol terminal in Scarpa Flow, Orkney, until the end of the field’s useful life in the 2030s.
In May, a team was set up to start the preliminary design and engineering study for development of the Marigold field, owned by Ithaca and Hibiscus, with the Piper Bravo platform operated by Repsol Sinopec UK (estimated maximum production of 40 Kboe/d and 12 Mscf/d).
• Libya: interruptions due to security conditions.
In January, March and April, there were interruptions in production at the El Sharara Field over security concerns. lFor more information, see Note 20.3 to the consolidated financial statements).

5 Performance of our businesses
• Algeria: increased stake in Reggane.
In July, Repsol exercised its preferential subscription right to buy the Edison company’s stake in the Reggane Nord natural gas project. The operation is part of the European strategy to seek opportunities to increase its stake in gas supplies to Europe. The shareholding percentages will be as follows: Repsol (operator, 36%), Sonatrach (40%), W-D (24%).
Operations have carried on normally despite the Friendship, Good Neighbor and Cooperation Treaty that was signed between both countries falling apart. l For more information see Note 20.3 to the consolidated financial statements).
• Russia: exit from the country.
In January, the last exploratory assets were sold to Gazprom Neft.
• Malaysia and Vietnam: exit from both countries.
In January, the sale was completed of the PM3 CAA, Kinabalu, PM305/314 assets in Malaysia and block 46 CN in Vietnam to a subsidiary of Hibiscus Petroleum.
In May, approval was received for the transfer of exploratory blocks 133-134 and 156-159 to Petrovietnam, meaning the cessation of activities in Vietnam.
• Greece: exit from the country.
In January, the sale of 50% of the Ionian block to Hellenic Petroleum was approved, putting an end to activities in the country.

1 2022 Overview
2021-2025 Strategic Plan
Returns Cash generation in a complex environment
Digitalization Industry 4.0. with a boost • Improved asset availability to maximize performance and optimize maintenance costs (-5% by 2025) to integration and improved decision making • Use of smart energy optimizers to reduce consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (-0,1Mt CO rate (2) of t/d)
New platforms
Main events 2022 was marked by the continued recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 in the first months of the year, and later by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to an increase in prices in the international crude oil, gasoline and diesel markets, significantly affecting global demand and the margin of Refining and Chemicals. In this environment, the Industrial businesses adapted their production, logistics and commercial schemes to the changing situation. The volatility in demand also required the Trading activity to adapt within the Industrials value chain (chartered vessels and time- charter voyages), while Wholesale and Gas Trading was affected by unprecedented levels of volatility as gas prices continue to rise, especially in Europe, but also in North America.
The volatility in prices made it possible to capture better margins occasionally, but the war has worsened the environment in which, foreseeably, the Industrial businesses must operate, and therefore significant impairments in the value of the assets were recognized in the period l For more information, see Section 4.1 Results
All this did not put a brake on the push for further progress toward decarbonization. This can be seen in the progress made in circular economy and advanced biofuel projects at industrial complexes, with new plants for 100% recyclable polymeric materials, and in the development of renewable hydrogen being carried out by various consortiums in the Iberian Peninsula.
5.2.1. Refining

Performance: high margins and spill in Peru
Last year was heavily affected by the international tensions arising from the war, most notably affecting Europe. Despite this environment, Repsol continued to run its business as an essential service for society and to guarantee supply in Spain.
The volatile environment resulting from these international tensions impacted the refining margin indicator, which retreated throughout 2021 and in the early months of 2022, largely due to the decline in demand for fuel. This situation promptly turned on its head in the second quarter of 2022, when international tensions and the veto on imports of raw materials and products from Russia led to a mismatch between supply and demand and, consequently, to higher world reference prices. This supply-demand mismatch was compounded by the endemic state of refining in the European Union, which has reduced its capacity by more than 10% in the last decade, mainly due to the closure of 24 facilities caused by an environment of low profitability and regulatory uncertainty. All of this ultimately fed through to the refining margin indicator, which reacted by climbing sharply to an average of $28.8 per barrel in June.

1 2022 Overview
However, between July and September there was then a further decline in the refining margin index to $12.7/bbl on average, mainly due to high energy costs. In the last period of the year, volatility remained very high, with the average annual indicator of the refining margin index in Spain rising to 15.6 (4.4 $/bbl in 2021 for the same period). Meanwhile, average distillation utilization was 86% in Spain compared to 76% in the previous year.

5 Performance of our businesses
In Peru, the refining margin indicator stood at 18.5 dollars per barrel, up from 6.3 dollars per barrel in 2021 as a result of efficiencies in crude purchases, low sulfur fuel oil production and pricing mechanisms in the country. The country’s performance was heavily affected by an oil spill that occurred on January 15, caused by an uncontrolled movement of a vessel that was unloading crude oil at the Pampilla refinery. lFor more information, see section 6. Sustainability and Note 29.1 Environmental investment, expenses and provisions of the 2022 consolidated financial statements.
The average level of distillation in the year was 80%, compared to 96.2% in 2021, largely due to the incident, although levels gradually recovered throughout the year.
