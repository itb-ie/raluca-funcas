Integrated Management Report 2022

Dear shareholders,
In 2022 we were reminded once again that energy dependence remains one of the main weaknesses of the European economy. Our continent does not have enough energy of its own, so we have to import it from countries that often do not share our values or our environmental standards. A unified and stable energy model is therefore key to prevent unexpected events, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, from jeopardizing the well-being of our society.
Repsol Group

==Page <Page:4>==

This unjustified and wholly unacceptable action led to one of the biggest humanitarian crises in Europe since the Second World War, resulting in the displacement of millions of people, the destruction of civilian infrastructure and, sadly, the loss of thousands of lives. I would like to express my unwavering support for the people of Ukraine, in the hope that a solution to this conflict will be found and the rebuilding can soon begin, in which those affected can certainly count on the support of the European Union.
Aside from the humanitarian toll, the invasion of Ukraine has caused a profound energy crisis. The sanctions placed on Russia and its response by cutting the supply of gas into Europe called into question our continent’s ability to find a reliable supply of hydrocarbons, quickly pushing up the prices of energy, metals and agricultural commodities. The consequences were soon felt, and throughout 2022 we witnessed a sharp rise in inflation and a slowdown in economic activity.
However, the war in Ukraine has not been the only factor jeopardizing the energy “trilemma” of security of supply, affordable prices and decarbonization. In Europe we have spent years focusing our energy policy on reducing emissions, with the design of a secure and competitively priced system taking a back seat. What this means, as indeed and Spanish regulations to respect the principle of we saw last year, is that we rely excessively on Russian gas supplies and that today many households and businesses are finding it hard to pay their energy bills.
A smarter energy transition
The crisis we are now enduring also reveals certain failures in the energy transition process designed by the European authorities. For this reason, we believe that it is now high time to seriously rethink the EU’s route to minimizing its greenhouse gas emissions, which still focuses on replacing the use of fossil fuels as soon as possible. In our expert view, we consider this decision to be overly hasty and unrealistic and fear that it may threaten the economy.
As an alternative, our sector would call for the development of a smarter energy transition that minimizes emissions as soon as possible, but always at a cost that society can afford and without making our industry less competitive in the process. To succeed in this task, it is important for European
Integrated Management Report 2022

technological neutrality, which means fostering the development of all solutions that can contribute to decarbonization, without prohibiting any technology a priori. Notably, this is a path that certain major players, including the United States, are already following.
The key is to diversify our options, without focusing on a single technology. And that is precisely what we are doing at Repsol, where we have long been committed to a multi- energy strategy to reduce our emissions and guarantee the security of energy supply for the benefit of society. More precisely, our strategy is to combine the deployment of new alternatives, such as hydrogen and renewable liquid fuels, with a gradual but planned reduction in the use of hydrocarbons, which, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), will still be needed in the coming decades within key sectors of the economy, such as heavy industry, transportation, petrochemicals and healthcare, as well as for the production of a multitude of everyday items.
“Our industry calls for the
development of a smarter energy transition; one that minimizes emissions as soon as possible, but always at a cost that society can afford and without making our industry less competitive in the process.”
Repsol Group

==Page <Page:5>==

Given these forecasts, we believe that walking away from hydrocarbon production is not the way to go at this time. Oil and gas will still be part of our energy mix in 2050, to a greater or lesser extent, so it is best to concentrate our efforts on using them as efficiently as possible. With this in mind, our industry has been investing heavily for years to reduce both energy consumption and emissions across all of its processes and products, while also developing innovative technologies such as those used to capture, use and store CO2 from the atmosphere or from an industrial facility.
All these developments demonstrate that European industry can, and indeed must, play a strategic role in decarbonization, thanks to our high capacity to innovate and develop new technologies. To unlock our full potential, we need regulation to be more supportive and protective of industry, with flexible and inclusive policies that drive innovation and avoid prohibitions that only hinder the competitiveness of a sector that, in the coming years, faces the daunting challenge of undertaking the biggest transformation in its history as we adapt to the demands of the energy transition.
Moreover, this transformation process is a hugely important opportunity to regain the leading role lost by the European industrial sector, which in the last decade, to give just one example, has had to endure the closure of 20 or so refineries due to an increasingly restrictive regulatory landscape in the field of hydrocarbons. It is time, therefore, to reindustrialize the continent, to continue to create jobs, to transform existing facilities to make them more energy efficient and to be able to manufacture the circular materials and low carbon footprint products that our economy now needs.
Spanish industry, a key player in the energy transition
To seize the opportunities offered by the energy transition, our industry’s strategy is to transform —not replace— existing industrial facilities, adapting them to use new forms of energy as we build and develop the circular economy. At Repsol, we have been firmly committed to this industrial transformation for years, through which we aim to convert our complexes into multi-energy hubs, capable also of treating different types of waste and producing, among other products, renewable liquid fuels, which are essential for reducing the carbon footprint across all transport sectors.
Integrated Management Report 2022

“Our strategy is to combine
The industrial transformation we are now undergoing shows that it is possible to strike the right balance between economic development and energy transition. As confirmed by our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, at Repsol we are aware that we must move quickly to address climate change, but also that we must do so without bringing the economy to a halt or destroying our industrial fabric in the process. To achieve this, we strongly advocate close collaboration between companies and authorities, in the conviction that our response must be coordinated, with regulatory decisions based on technological progress and not on ideology, and with simpler and clearer rules for all players in the sector.
The decarbonization of the economy is one of the greatest challenges of our time and we must face it together. Rest assured that Repsol has pledged to continue leading this process.
Thank you for your support and trust.

Message from the CEO
Integrated Management Report 2022

Dear shareholders,
I am writing to you after a year in which, as a company, we have once again faced enormous challenges, calling for the utmost flexibility and agility. Just when it seemed that we were about to recover a degree of normality in the wake of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine erupted; an unjustified invasion that, in addition to the human tragedy, brought new uncertainty, pushed up commodity prices and threatened our energy supply capacity. Allow me to start this letter by expressing my unflinching support for the people of Ukraine and all the victims of this tragedy. I sincerely hope that a solution to this conflict can be found as soon as possible, as it is not something that should be taking place in this day and age.
Repsol Group

==Page <Page:7>==

The invasion of Ukraine caused crude oil and gas prices to rise sharply during the first half of the year, and this upward pressure increased further as new sanctions against Russia were announced. Oil prices reached figures close to US$140 per barrel, a level not seen since 2008, before plummeting to below US$80 during the second half of the year amid fears of a global economic recession.
Faced with this complex situation, in 2022 Repsol reinforced its contribution as an essential service to society, increasing its inventories by more than €2,000 million to guarantee the supply of energy to the national market and the operation of its refineries.
We also did our level best to cushion the effects that the market volatility could have on our customers, by becoming the first company to offer significant discounts on the fuels we supply at our service stations in Spain. Between March 16 and December 31, 2022, we generated savings of €500 million for our customers, beyond those already achieved in the previous year. Our sensitivity to the current situation, which is still fraught with uncertainty, prompted us to extend these discounts until March 31, 2023, once again ahead of other market players.
We need to invest in industry
Last year was proof that the necessary improvement in sustainability is not the only challenge facing the energy sector. Coming up with a decarbonization model to transform the industry while also guaranteeing its future viability is also a key strategic concern. We operate in a sector of the economy that generates employment (200,000 families rely, in one way or another, on the refining sector in our country), makes Spain more energy independent and is essential for making further progress in the fight against climate change.
Our commitment to the future of industry is clear, with our investment in refineries having averaged €1 billion per year since 2008. This has allowed us to optimize the use of our assets and increase their efficiency and flexibility, as evidenced by the more than 50% reduction in gas consumption at our industrial facilities, compared to previous periods. Thanks to these steps, we have provided a better response to the tensions within the international fuel market, while at the same time helping to secure energy supply in Spain.
However, despite the positive results obtained by this business and its valuable contribution to the wellbeing of everyone, the outlook for the sector remains precarious. Europe has curtailed its refining capacity by more than 10% in the last decade, compounded by regulatory and fiscal uncertainty. The long-term profitability and competitiveness of these facilities will suffer if the endemic situation into which the European sector has been plunged is not corrected soon.

Notable progress toward our strategic objectives
The best tools for making it through this tumultuous period are our integrated business model and the 2021–2025 Strategic Plan, a roadmap focused on flexibility, efficiency and value creation that has allowed us to perform remarkably well so far. In 2022, we made further progress toward the objectives envisioned in the plan, by transforming the portfolio to decarbonize our activities, welcoming strategic partners, strengthening our balance sheet and increasing the dividend.
You will surely agree with me that we have taken hugely significant steps in relation to our dividend, such as the 11% increase in cash remuneration for 2023, allowing us to achieve our 2024 target under the Strategic Plan ahead of schedule. Notably, we have achieved our share buyback and redemption target three years ahead of schedule, with 200 million shares redeemed at the end of 2022, a target initially set for the entire 2021–2025 period. Both measures have helped to cement our status as one of the most attractive companies in the sector —and indeed on the IBEX-35 bluechip index— when it comes to shareholder remuneration, this being a target we set ourselves at the beginning of this strategic cycle. Our strong cash generation certainly helped in this regard and also paved the way for a significant reduction in net debt.
Our net profit for the year, at €4,251 million, allows us to partially offset the losses experienced in 2019 and 2020, when the global health pandemic hit us hard. Our businesses have performed remarkably well, while deepening their transformation and further boosting our multi-energy profile.
prioritized the security of supply in Spain by increasing its hydrocarbon inventories by more than €2,000 million.”
Repsol Group

==Page <Page:8>==

At this point I would like to highlight two milestones at our Upstream and Renewables divisions, which, with the incorporation of new strategic partners, have underscored the strength of their respective business models. Both operations demonstrate the value and worth of the roadmap for these divisions and, above all, reinforce our decarbonization strategy, based on the use of all technologies capable of reducing emissions, as well as the digitalization of our processes to improve decision-making and become more efficient.
Towards the decarbonization of our assets
A key objective under this strategy is the development of renewable energies. To become a global operator, in 2022 we increased our international presence by acquiring Asterion Energies, which has a significant portfolio of projects in Spain and Italy, and by starting up our first photovoltaic plant in the United States, among other operations. In Spain, we launched Solar360, a joint venture with Telefónica to enable the self-consumption of photovoltaic energy by individuals, neighborhood communities and businesses.
In the realm of mobility, our main commitment for bringing about an immediate reduction in emissions within the sector is advanced biofuels. These renewable fuels can be used in today’s engines, making them essential in minimizing the carbon footprint across all transport sectors. The plant we are now building at our Cartagena refinery, the first in Spain, will start operating in late 2023 and will produce 250,000 metric tons of these fuels per year from organic waste.
This circular economy project is the best example of the industrial transformation going on at Repsol, which is turning its facilities into multi-energy hubs capable of treating all manner of raw materials to manufacture more sustainable products. One of the main drivers of this process by 2050. will be renewable hydrogen, the production of which we want to lead in Spain by 2030. To succeed, we have created Shyne (Spanish Hydrogen Network), the largest consortium for this sustainable gas, and we will also be launching several key projects in and around our industrial centers.
All these initiatives show that Repsol will continue to invest in the transformation of its industry, which will ultimately boost the Spanish economy and protect jobs within the sector. We are therefore firmly committed to a strategy based on the sustainable development of society, in which the 17 goals of the UN Agenda 2030 are fully integrated. In addition, in our daily running of the business we have pledged to respect the 10 Principles of the Global Compact
6 Integrated Management Report 2022
on human rights, labor standards, anti-corruption and the environment, as evidenced by our adherence to the CEO Water Mandate last year, which will lead to further improvements in water management at our facilities.
Aside from these initiatives, I would be remiss not to mention the signing of the new Framework Agreement, governing key labor aspects such as wage increases and new teleworking arrangements. The commitment shown by our employees to this project and the support of our shareholders have been essential to achieving our objectives and pursuing our decarbonization strategy, which will ultimately allow us to become a net zero emissions company
To all of you, my most sincere appreciation and gratitude.
“Repsol will continue to invest in the transformation of its industry, which will ultimately boost the Spanish economy and protect jobs within the sector.”

1. 2022 Overview
Complex international context While still in the recovery phase from the COVID-19 crisis, 2022 was affected by the global tensions caused by the war in Ukraine. Disruptions in supply chains, increased energy prices and, in general, a worsening of inflationary processes, as well as the tightening of financial conditions and the announcement of government policies to deal with this situation, have progressively marked the period, which ends with concern about developments in the energy crisis will in Europe and the economic situation in general.
In this context of volatility and uncertainty about the future, the demand for our products increased during the year following a relaxation of the mobility restrictions imposed due to the pandemic, and the international reference prices of a large proportion of our products have risen.lFor more information, see section 3. Environment
Improved results and financial position In 2022, we posted a profit of €4,251 million, a good result, for sure, but it is neither the best in our history nor is it yet sufficient, together with the profit reported a year earlier, to recoup the losses reported in 2019 and 2020. These strong earnings are not the result of chance but the product of a successful strategy and management focused on efficiency and business transformation.
In particular, the significant investments made in past years in the refining industrial complexes in Spain (when many of our international competitors reduced their capacity) have allowed us now to increase and optimize the use of our facilities in response to supply tensions in the international fuel market. In addition to this, the sound management of our portfolio of international oil and gas production assets, which we initiated in the previous context of very low prices, has allowed us to improve our profitability during the new cycle.

Net income
Adjusted net income, which reflects the ordinary performance of the businesses, came to €6,661 million in 2022 (€2,454 in 2021), with Upstream and Industrial turning in notable performances.
The strong results at Upstream (€3,029 million) were driven by the rise in crude and gas prices. In the Industrial segment, the better results (€3,150 million) are explained by the increase in margins and production at the Refining businesses, offset by the drop in margins and demand at Chemicals.
At Commercial and Renewables (€540 million), in line with 2021, the decline in margins in the Service Stations business in Spain, owing to the discounts applied by Repsol on the retail selling price of fuels (more than €500 million additional discounts throughout 2022), was compensated by the increase in sale volumes following the lifting of restrictions during the pandemic and by better results at the low-carbon electricity generation businesses driven by increased production and high electricity prices.
The Inventory effect (€75 million), which shows the impact of crude prices on our inventories, was not significant during the period, as the increase in the first half of the year was neutralized by the decline seen in the second half.

Lastly, Special items (€-2,485 million) comprise mainly the impairment recognized at the refineries in Spain due to the tougher regulatory and fiscal framework in Europe and its impact on the profitability and competitiveness of our facilities, which, as envisioned in the strategic plan, must undergo a profound industrial transformation to guarantee their future sustainability in the context of energy transition.
As a result net income obtained in the period came to €4,251 million (€2,499 million in 2021).
This net income includes a corporate income tax expense of €3,447 million (effective rate of 44%). The Group’s tax contribution was the highest in its history, with a total payment in 2022 of €17,002 million in tax, with €11,923 paid in Spain (70%).
The increase in EBITDA (€13,813 million) allowed Repsol to obtain a high cash flow from operations (€8,923 million), despite the increase in working capital (€-1,871 million), impacted by the higher prices and volumes of inventories and an increase in tax payments. Free cash flow, which includes investments made during the period, amounted to €5,211 million. This improvement allowed us to significantly reduce net debt, which came to €2,256 million (leverage ratio of 8.0%), and increase liquidity (€12,014 million).
This solid financial position has been endorsed by rating agencies, with both Standard & Poor's and Moody’s upgrading Repsol's long-term rating by one notch, with a stable outlook.
In 2022, the share price recovered significantly (+42%) and the shareholder remuneration amounted to €0.63 per share, 7% higher than in 2021. In addition, capital reductions through the redemption of a total of 200 million treasury shares improved earnings per share. l For more information, see section 4.

5 Performance of Sustainability Outlook our businesses
Business performance and transformation Repsol continued its process of transformation in 2022. Key company actions in 2022 included the process of making business management more efficient and agile in order to adapt to the new situation in the markets, the incorporation of new technologies and the digitalization of operations, as well as the drive to build new businesses and transform traditional ones to achieve the decarbonization objectives and align with the energy transition environment.
At Upstream, the agreement to sell 25% of the stake in the entire Upstream business to EIG Global Energy Partners (EIG) was a particular highlight. This not only unlocks the value of the segment but will allow us to advance in fulfilling key objectives of the Strategic Plan. Asset portfolios were dynamically managed during the period to prioritize value over volume and to focus on strategic assets and on countries that offer competitive advantages; thus, the withdrawal from certain countries (Russia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Ecuador and Greece) and the sale of significant assets in Canada (Chauvin, Duvernay and Montney) were completed, while progress was made in the development of key projects in the United States (Alaska, Marcellus, Eagle Ford and Gulf of Mexico), Brazil, Trinidad, Colombia and Norway.
At Industrial, Refining adjusted its production, logistics and commercial schemes to respond to the new environment, characterized by a recovery in demand and in margins. The Chemicals businesses maintained an efficient operation without any significant operating incidents, although their activity was notably affected by lower demand, especially in the second half of the year. The Group also continued to focus heavily on innovation and digitalization, approving significant investments and industrial projects (renewable hydrogen, circular economy and differentiated materials, and production of advanced biofuels) to demonstrate how decarbonization, approached from a technology-neutral perspective, can guarantee the future and profitability of our industrial complexes.
Industrial transformation and push toward decarbonization
• New partners to bring out the value of the Upstream segment and achieve growth in Renewables.
• New projects and commitment to Hydrogen to transform and guarantee the future sustainability of our industrial businesses.
• Shareholders approve the climate change strategy.

At Commercial, highlights included an increase in sales of fuels in the Mobility businesses in Spain and in Aviation following the lifting of mobility restrictions, as well as the necessary adaptation to the current context of high prices in the electricity and gas retail businesses. Repsol showed its commitment to its customers by being the first operator in Spain to establish voluntary discounts at gas stations, lowering its margins to alleviate the impact on consumers of the rise in fuel prices. The customer-focused business strategy was driven by growth in the Waylet payment app (reaching 5.5 million users) and an increase in electricity and gas customers (climbing to 1.5 million customers).
At Renewables, Repsol’s objectives for building this business were reinforced by the completion of the sale of a 25% stake to Crédit Agricole Assurances and funds managed by Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP); with a c0mmitment to invest 6 GW by 2025 and 20 GW by 2030, which includes entering new markets and incorporating complementary technologies, such as offshore wind power and battery storage. Meanwhile, the asset rotation strategy continued throughout the period, to bring in new investors on various projects, including The Renewable Infrastructures Group (TRIG) and Pontegadea Group. The company also continued to bring projects into operation in Spain and the United States and to add new projects to the portfolio under development. In December, an agreement was reached to acquire 100% of Asterion Energies, which manages a portfolio of renewable assets of 7,700 MW in Spain, Italy and France.
Repsol made further progress in decarbonization toward achieving the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The final phase of construction at the Cartagena refinery of the first advanced biofuels plant in Spain began in March, and a stake was acquired in the Canadian company Enerkem, a world leader in the production of renewable fuels and chemical products through gasification of non-recyclable waste. Repsol has continued to develop its renewable hydrogen strategy by participating in the Regionals Valleys where it has significant activity (Coruña, Castilla-La Mancha, the Basque Country, Murcia and Catalonia) and by leading the consortium SHYNE (Spanish Hydrogen Network), which comprises 35 entities from different sectors. It should also be noted that, in addition to production projects for industrial and mobility use, Repsol promotes alliances such as the one recently agreed with Navantia for the installation of an hydrogen electrolyzer plant at its shipyards. l For more information, see section 5.

In the calls for expressions of interest for Next Generation European funds launched by the Government of Spain, in 2022 Repsol presented a portfolio of 34 projects that combine technology, decarbonization, digitalization and circular economy, the creation of quality jobs and territorial balance, for an initial associated investment of €6,000 million. In 2022, Repsol submitted 325 dossiers under the European Union’s recovery and resilience funds, securing €38 million in grants.
Sustainability The 2022 General Shareholders’ Meeting of Repsol, S.A. approved the company’s climate change strategy. The Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which measures progress towards our decarbonization target, reached 70.3 g/CO2e/ MJ (down 10% on the base year of 2016; target of -15% by 2025). l For more information, see section 6.1. Energy transition and Climate change.
The Company has agreed upon the “Framework Agreement” with the workers' representatives, which will remain in force until the end of 2024. The agreement governs important aspects such as wage increases and new teleworking arrangements, thus, improving the value proposition for employees in a context of high uncertainty. l For more information, see section 6.5. People.
Regrettably, the following safety-related events took place during the year. In January, during the unloading of crude oil in Ventanilla, Peru, an uncontrolled movement of the vessel Mare Doricum caused an oil spill at sea, giving rise to one of the worst events experienced by the company during its nearly 30 years operating in this country. The origin of the accident is still under investigation and Repsol does not believe it was at fault, though the company has brought all of its financial, technological and human resources to bear in remediating the effects of the spill in the shortest possible time; at of the date of this report, it has completed the first response cleanup actions in the affected areas and the Rehabilitation Plans are being drawn up. l For more information, see section 6.6.3 Spill management.
Moreover, during 2022, several incidents took place in the Industrial Complexes, as a result of which three people died (all of them contractor personnel).l For more information, see section 6.6.1 Safety management system.

Board Remuneration
Directors receive fixed remuneration for fulfilling their supervisory and decision-making duties. Aside from the remuneration payable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, remuneration is calculated by assigning points for seats held on the Board or its various committees, or for holding specific positions on those bodies. Each point has a remuneration equivalence, meaning there is no difference in remuneration by gender. Detailed information regarding the application of the Remuneration Policy for Directors is set out in Repsol’s Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration available at www.repsol.com.

2.5 Strategy
In December 2019, Repsol was the first company in the sector to announce its commitment to become a net zero emissions company by 2050, which represented the start of its strategic reorientation. l For more information, see section 6.1 Energy transition and climate change.
The Strategic Plan 2021-2025 (SP 21-25 or the Plan) pursues the Company's transformation and sets the tone for accelerating the energy transition, following a cost-effective , realistic path and ensuring profitability, future success and maximum value for shareholders.
The Plan envisions two distinct periods: the first (2021-2022) is focused on ensuring financial robustness by prioritizing efficiency, investment reduction and capital optimization, while undertaking projects to lead the energy transition; the second (2023-2025), once the impact of the COVID-19 crisis is behind us, will focus on accelerating transformation and growth.l For more information, see www.repsol.com.
In 2021, new objectives were announced aimed at accelerating the transformation and decarbonization of businesses with a new decarbonization roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, increasing the previous ambition presented in the Strategic Plan, so that the carbon intensity indicator is reduced by 15% in 2025, 28% in 2030 and 55% in 2040, compared to what was planned previously: 12%, 25% and 50%, respectively.
In 2022, Repsol promoted its transformation into a multi- energy company, reinforcing its leadership in the energy transition and accelerating compliance with the key objectives of the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan through three strategic agreements:
• In September, an agreement was reached for the sale of

25% of Repsol’s hydrocarbon Upstream business to EIG (through its subsidiary Breakwater Energy Holdings S.A.R.L.) in exchange for $3,350 million (subject to the customary pricing adjustments for this kind of transaction). The agreement values the Upstream business at $19,000 million.
The transaction demonstrates Repsol's ongoing commitment to generating shareholder value, crystallizing the implicit value of its Upstream business. It strengthens the investment capacity of its energy transition strategy, with a less leveraged position that allows greater investment in decarbonization initiatives.
The agreement envisions a potential stock market launch of this business, foreseeably in the United States, as of 2026, provided that the market conditions are favorable.

The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the year, once the customary regulatory clearance has been secured and the corporate restructuring of Repsol’s Upstream business is finalized.

• In December, an agreement was reached to purchase
The incorporation of partners at Repsol Renovables and the purchase of new renewable generation assets reinforces the commitment to investment for the growth of this business, in line with the ambitious objectives of the Plan to reach 6 GW of installed renewable generation capacity by 2025 and 20 GW by 2030, to enter into new markets and to incorporate complementary technologies, such as offshore wind power and storage.
Additionally, Repsol continues to make progress in fulfilling its strategic commitments, such as accelerating on the path of shareholder remuneration, having completed in just two years the repurchase of the two hundred million shares provided for in the Plan for the entire 21-25 period. lFor more information, see section 7.2 Outlook for our businesses.
consortium formed by the French insurer Crédit Agricole Assurances and funds managed by Energy Infrastructure Partners (EIP) was completed, generating cash of €986 million for the Group. Under the deal, the Repsol Renovables business is valued at €4,383 million2. The transaction demonstrates the strength of Repsol’s business and growth model, which was created just over three years ago. l For more information on this transaction, see Note 6.5 of the 2022 consolidated financial statements.
Asterion Energies, a development platform that manages a portfolio of 7,700 MW of renewable assets in Spain, Italy and France, in exchange for €560 million.
Asterion Energies’ asset portfolio includes 4,900 MW of solar photovoltaic generation and 2,800 MW of wind generation, of which 2,500 MW are in an advanced stage of development or under construction. In addition, Asterion Energies has a team of experts dedicated to the development of renewable and storage projects, which will be incorporated into Repsol’s ambitious growth project in this business.
At the date of preparing this report, the transaction is subject to the customary regulatory approvals and is expected to be closed shortly.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
In 2021, the progress made in vaccination allowed the economic recovery to take hold (adjusting its speed as new strains appeared) and allayed fears of significant structural damage.
However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, economies around the world were significantly affected by the imposition of trade sanctions targeting Russian individuals, companies and institutions, triggering a significant reduction in trade between the West and Russia, pushing up prices in global markets for commodities such as oil, natural gas and wheat, and causing inflationary pressures, bottlenecks in the supply chain and volatility in the financial and commodity markets. lFor more information on the risks and uncertainty arising from the war, see section 7.5 Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Recent economic trends
The global economy had finished 2021 showing high growth (world GDP grew by 6.0% in the year as a whole), in a context of recovery after the enormous shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
But the economic environment has had to face serious and new challenges since the beginning of 2022, marked by the confluence of three adverse forces: i) greater geopolitical tensions and rising raw material prices, both as a result of the war in Ukraine; ii) the slowdown in China due to a real estate crisis and closures of companies and factories under the “zero COVID” policy; iii) higher inflation, aggravated by the two previous factors, causing a cost-of-living crisis (as income and spending in real terms contract) and a strong response from central banks, which have rapidly tightened

financial conditions in a synchronized manner, accompanied by an appreciation of the dollar. This last factor is especially unfavorable to the growth of emerging countries, since a stronger dollar pushes up import prices and leads to a higher cost of servicing their hard-currency-denominated debt.
Monetary policy is being tightened much more firmly than expected at the beginning of the year. Indeed, the US Federal Reserve, which began the tightening cycle in March when it raised reference rates from 0% to 0.25%, finally brought rates up to 4.25% at the end of the year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) abandoned its negative policy rates in July and ended the year with reference rates at 2.5%.

According to the latest forecasts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF, World Economic Outlook January 2023), growth of 3.4% is expected in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023, but these forecasts appear overly optimistic and the risks to growth are skewed to the downside.
Regarding the exchange rate, the environment of high uncertainty and high liquidity needs in the first months of the pandemic intensified appreciation of the dollar, which

reached levels of 1.078 dollars/euro at the beginning of April 2020. However, subsequently the dollar tended to depreciate, especially against the euro, falling to levels of 1.22 dollars/euro at the beginning of 2021. This was because the reduction in risk aversion meant that the interest rate differential and the fundamentals became more significant when determining the exchange rate. But, starting in the last quarter of 2021, better progress in the United States' economic recovery, together with greater upward risks in inflation, led to a new appreciation of the dollar against the euro, which was intensified by greater speed and decision in the Fed's monetary tightening. The price reached 0.96 dollars/euro at the end of September, but more recently this trend has reversed somewhat, returning to a level of 1.06 dollars/euro in December. The average for 2022 was 1.05 dollars/euro.

Crude oil – Brent
Benchmark Brent crude oil went from trading at around 75 $/ their own quota. Nigeria and Angola stand out among the bbl at the end of 2021 to reach levels of 139 $/bbl in March. On February 23, one day before Russia invaded Ukraine, the Brent price was 96.8 $/bbl. After the invasion, prices skyrocketed, the Brent barrel increasing by more than 20% in ten days and reaching levels not seen since 2008.
In 2022, the price of a barrel of Brent crude averaged 101.3 $/ bbl, almost 40% more than in 2021, although prices fell significantly in the second half of the year. The war in Ukraine has been a determining factor in prices, because of the direct sanctions imposed by some governments on importing Russian oil, and because of self-imposed

embargoes by companies that previously imported crude oil and oil products from Russia. But the war was not the only factor to explain the rise in prices: the advances made last year in the vaccination processes and the progressive end of confinements had already supported economic development and mobility, resulting in increased demand for crude oil and oil products. Additionally, this solid demand for oil met with a short-term supply controlled by the OPEC+ group, and determined in the medium/long term by low investment in recent years. The result was a tight balance in the oil markets, increased by indirect factors such as the sharp increase in natural gas prices at the end of 2021 , which had a positive effect on the demand for oil for use, instead of natural gas, in electricity generation.
In principle, the most obvious impact of the war in Ukraine on the oil markets has to do with shorter supply. To give an idea of the importance of Russia in global energy markets, note that it is the third largest oil producer in the world, after the United States and Saudi Arabia (in January 2022, it produced 11.3 mb/d of petroleum, 10 mbbl/d of crude, 0.96 mbbl/d of condensates and 0.34 mbbl/d of natural gas liquids) and the world's largest exporter of oil to global markets (in December 2021 , it exported 7.8 mbbl/d, comprising 5 mbbl/d (64%) of crude oil and condensates and 2.8 mbbl/d of oil products, mainly made up of 1.1 mbbl/ d of diesel, 650 kbbl/d of fuel oil, 500 kbbl/d of naphtha and 280 kbbl/d of vacuum gasoil).
To reduce its dependency, the European Union imposed an embargo on the import of Russian crude oil by ship from December 5 and on the import of petroleum products as of February 5, 2023. The effect of this decision on prices is uncertain, although some analysts point to an environment of high prices in 2023. Any future sanctions in addition to those already implemented would create upside price risks.
The announcement of a 2 mb/d cut in production by the OPEC+ group adds even more uncertainty and volatility to the oil markets. The agreement provides for a reduction of 2 mb/d in its production from November 2022 to December 2023. However, it is estimated that the real and effective cut in the group's production will be in the range of 1 mb/d to 0.8 mb/d, as some members were already producing below
countries facing serious problems in increasing their production. In the first case, Nigeria's production has been affected by temporary problems, such as technical issues and interruptions, while Angola's production has been hampered by structural problems due to lack of investment and the decline of its most productive blocks. Regarding Russia, the general consensus points to a drop in its production in the range of 0.9 mb/d -1.4 mb/d in 2023. This would lead Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to bear the brunt of the cuts. Saudi Arabia could cut production by up to 520 kb/d, Iraq by 220 kb/d and the UAE by 160 kb/d.

Natural Gas - Henry Hub (HH)
In 2022 the Henry Hub price of US natural gas averaged 6.6 $/MBtu, well above the price in 2021 (3.9 $/MBtu), and occasionally climbing above 9 $/MBtu, setting all-time highs for the year. This increase in the price of gas was largely down to the dynamics of the domestic market. Demand remained high due partly to the boost in consumption in the residential, commercial and power generation sectors, and partly to the high exports of LNG, which regularly exceeded 13 Bcf/d for much of the second quarter of 2022. On the supply side, the maintenance of high production levels, especially in the third quarter of 2022, with levels around 100 Bcf/d, together with the slowdown in exports from the Freeport LNG terminal, acted as brakes on further potential price increases in the last months of the year. The high production volumes allowed inventories to be filled rapidly, which also helped to contain prices.

Additionally, the situation in the gas market after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine kept global market uncertainty and price volatility high. The need for gas in Europe and Asia secures the market niche for LNG coming from the United States, which should keep prices high in the short term.
Electricity prices
The average wholesale price of electricity in 2022 was 167.7 €/MWh, well above the 111.4 €/MWh for the same period in the previous year.This price would have to have added to it the adjustment applied to consumers in the market following implementation of the electricity price adjustment mechanism (known as the gas “cap”), which would give an effective average of close to 210 €/MWh.
This mechanism has caused combined-cycle plants to become more profitable. This means that some that were barely used before have been started up, boosting the consumption of gas for electricity generation despite its price. Meanwhile, the reduction in prices due to this mechanism has also caused a price differential with the French market. This has led to a shift in the direction of the interconnection, which has become a net exporter to France.
The increase in generation through combined cycle plants and exports was accompanied by notably lower hydro power generation in Spain during the period, due to the drought, and a sharp increase in photovoltaic generation (with changes of -45% and +33% respectively).
The lower operation of cogeneration plants is also very significant, affected at first by their being excluded for several months from the adjustment mechanism for consumers, meaning that their market share was absorbed by combined cycles, but also by lower industrial activity.
In the last few months of the year, a more favorable climate for renewables and somewhat more moderate gas prices allowed electricity prices to fall from the high figures reported in the summer, to a maximum hourly price of 700 €/MWh and a daily maximum of 545 €/MWh.
It should be noted that the increases in photovoltaic capacity implemented in recent months have not only led to new generation maximums being recorded, but have also to a change in the daily price profile, so that the lowest prices now occur in the early hours of the afternoon, instead of in the early morning, as was usual in the past.

CO emission allowances
The price of CO2 emission allowances fluctuated significantly during 2022, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and the economic climate. This uncertainty has caused a spread of 30 €/t in prices, which averaged 81.3 €/t in 2022, well above the 53.3 €/t traded at in the same period of 2021.
Despite the fuel price situation and lower security of supply, the European Union has made it clear that decarbonization is a priority objective, and this has continued to support prices. In late 2022, the European Council, the Parliament and the Commission provisionally agreed to increase to 62% the emission reduction to be reached by 2030 in the sectors covered by this regime (adapting to the new target of reducing CO2 emissions by 55% in the European economy as a whole by 2030 compared to 1990 – Fit for 55). Another factor driving up emissions prices is the forecast of more coal-fired generation in countries that may have less gas supplied from Russia, especially Germany.

Net income
The results for 2022 are affected by the complex geopolitical, macroeconomic and global energy context.
The improved results reflect the advantage taken of the opportunities offered by the current environment to some of our businesses (recovery in demand for fuels due to fewer restrictions on mobility, increase in crude oil and gas prices, improvement in the international refining margin), thanks to the company’s strong industrial investment policy in previous years and its optimization of the international portfolio of oil and gas Upstream assets undertaken in the previous environment of very low prices.
Conversely, the discounts applied at service stations to mitigate the effects of the war and the tightening of future conditions for the activity of our businesses, notably increased regulatory and fiscal pressure, have had a negative impact on the results and prompted the recognition of impairment losses, mainly at the Refining Spain business.
Adjusted net income for the period amounted to €6,661 million, 171% higher than in the previous year, driven by the notable performance of the Refining and Trading businesses (high margins), Upstream (increased prices and efficiency measures deployed) and Renewables and Low Carbon Generation (high prices and higher production), and to a lesser extent, due to the positive impact of the treasury stock position and lower interest on the financial result.
With the inventory effect (€75 million) and special items (€-2,485 million, mainly impairment on Refining assets), net income amounted to €4,251 million.
Recovering prices at Upstream and margins at Industrial businesses, coupled with increased sales at the Commercial businesses, combined to push up EBITDA significantly in the period to €13,813 million (vs. €8,170 million in 2021).

Average production for the period was -4% down on 2021 (at 550 Kboe/d) and investment increased in both development and exploration. l For more information on the activities in the segment, see section 5.1 Upstream
Adjusted net income at Upstream amounted to €3,029 million, up €1,342 million on 2021.
The improvement in results is explained by the positive impact of higher realization prices for crude oil (+44%) and gas(+61%), which significantly boosted the results obtained in the United States, Norway, Trinidad and Tobago, Libya, Brazil, the United Kingdom and Peru, and by the appreciation of the dollar.
These positive impacts were partially offset by:
• a lower volume of sales compared to the previous year.
• higher taxes on production and hydrocarbon royalties, in
• higher production costs due to, among others, the start-up
• increased expenses in exploration due to a more intense

Investments in 2022 totaled €925 million, mainly in the expansion of renewables in the United States (Frye Solar, Outpost and Jicarilla), and for the development and commissioning of new renewable facilities in Spain (Delta II and Sigma). They were up 12% on 2021, which included the acquisition of 40% of the US company Hecate Energy Group, LLC. and contributions for the development of projects in Chile (through the joint venture with Ibereólica). lFor more information on the segment’s activities, see section 5.3 Commercial and Renewables.
Corporate and others
Earnings for 2022 amounted to €-58 million (vs. €-381 million in 2021). This change is largely down to an improved financial result, which was positively impacted by higher earnings from treasury stock positions and interest rates, lower interest on debt, and higher remuneration from investments due to the robust financial position (debt reduction of 61%) and high liquidity.
At Corporate, further efforts were made to reduce corporate costs, with results in line with those reported in 2021, while continuing to focus on digitalization and technology initiatives.

Turning to asset impairment, the main instances of impairment related to certain Refining assets in Spain. Medium and long-term expectations have been downgraded as a result of the new European measures to accelerate the energy transition, the increase in taxes and the negative impact (beyond the short term) of market dynamics driven by the war. These new circumstances will affect the profitability and competitiveness of some facilities and have led to provisions being recognized for impairment and dismantling of those units that would be more difficult to adapt in response to an accelerated energy transition and decarbonization process. The impact on results was -€1,479 million (-€1,247 million after tax). For more information on impairment, see Note 20 – Asset impairment to the 2022 consolidated financial statements.

(1) Dividends include perpetual bond coupons (other equity instruments) and those corresponding to non-controlling interests. (2) Highlights in 2022 included the sales of 25% of Repsol Renovables and 49% of the stakes held in the Valdesolar and Kappa solar facilities (highlights in 2021: the Sale of Delta I).
Cash flow from operations (€8,923 million) was much higher than the figure reported in 2021, due to a significant increase in EBITDA in almost all businesses except for Chemicals and Mobility. This positive impact was partially offset by the higher taxes paid (Upstream and Refining performance) and by the negative impact of the higher cost of inventories (prices and volumes) and the acquisition of CO2 allowances.
The increase in investments, compared to the previous year (+53%), resulted in lower cash flow from investing activities (€-3,712 million). Among the investments in 2022, those that stand out correspond to the Upstream segment (especially those made in the United States, including the disbursement for the acquisition of Rockdale in Marcellus) and to the Industrial segment (maintenance and improvement of the activities of the industrial complexes, start-up of decarbonization projects and purchase of 14% of Enerkem), as well as the commitments in Renewables to continue the international expansion in the United States and the development of projects in Spain. On the divestments side, highlights at Upstream included the cash released from the sale of assets in Canada and the divestments made in Malaysia and Russia.
Free cash flow amounted to €5,211 million, much higher than the €2,839 reported in 2021. In addition to this free cash flow, we have the cash obtained from the sale of 25% of Repsol Renovables and 49% of the Valdesolar and Kappa facilities without loss of control (transaction with non- controlling interests) (€1,130 million in total). Cash generated in 2022 amounts to €3,228 million, once Repsol has paid the remuneration to its shareholders (higher dividends), perpetual bond holders (-€79 million) and non- controlling interests (-€38 million), and met the cost of acquiring treasury stock (€-1,714 million) and financing and leasing costs (€-397 million). This cash generation is considerably higher than the €1,293 million reported in 2021.

4.4 Shareholder remuneration
Repsol does not have a formal policy on dividends, and the Company's decisions on shareholder return depend on several factors, including the performance of its businesses and its operating results.
The cash remuneration received by shareholders in 20221 was 0.63 €/share, which included:
• a dividend of €0.30 gross per share paid in January,
• a dividend of €0.33 gross per share paid out in July
Additionally, in May3, October4 and December5 three capital reductions have been carried out, through the redemption, in each of the first two, of 75 million treasury shares and of 50 million shares in the third (a total of 200 million shares redeemed), which contributed to shareholder remuneration by increasing earnings per share.
Shareholder remuneration in 2023
In January 2023, shareholders were remunerated with €0.35 gross per share through the distribution of: (i) €0.325 gross per share paid out against voluntary reserves6; and (ii) a dividend of €0.025 gross per share paid out against 2022 earnings. The total amount paid out came to €454 million.7
In October the Board of Directors agreed to submit for the approval of shareholders, at the next Annual General Meeting to be held in 2023, a final dividend of €0.35 gross per share. Consequently, if the above-mentioned proposal is approved by the 2023 General Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders will receive a cash remuneration of €0.70 gross per share in 2023 (11% higher than in 2022).
Lastly, in February 2023, the Board of Directors agreed to launch a share buyback program targeting a maximum of 35 million treasury shares and to propose to the next Annual General Meeting a capital reduction through the redemption of 50 million treasury shares.

Main events
Repsol considers its Upstream business, including its long- term maintenance and consolidation, to be strategic. In the context of dynamic permanent management of the business portfolio, various opportunities were analyzed, resulting in the announcement, in September, of an agreement with the United States institutional investor EIG for the sale of a 25% stake.l For more information, see section 2.5 Strategy.
The efficiency measures and greater focus on the value of the (two in Colombia and one each in the United States, Bolivia, portfolio of oil and gas assets, which were implemented in an environment of low prices, have been essential in taking full advantage of profitability in the current cycle of high prices.l For more information, see section 4.1 Results.
Management of the asset portfolio
In 2022, in addition to the agreement for the sale of 25% of the Upstream business, divestments (exiting countries) were completed in Malaysia, Russia, Ecuador and Greece, and various assets in Canada (Duvernay, Chauvin and Montney) were sold.
In order to focus on priority geographic areas, additional investments were completed in Marcellus, with the assets acquired from Rockdale Marcellus LLC and Abarta, and an agreement was announced to acquire new assets at Eagle Ford.
Average production
Average production totaled 550 Kboe/d in 2022, 4% Kboe/d lower than the previous year, mainly due to the sale of production assets in Canada, Algeria (TFT-II) and Norway (Brage) in 2021 and the Repsol Group’s exit from certain countries (Malaysia, Ecuador, Russia and Vietnam), intermittent stoppages in Libya over security concerns and natural decline of the fields and the effect of higher prices on operating contracts in Bolivia. All of this was partially offset by the commissioning of new wells at the non-conventional

assets of Marcellus and Eagle Ford in the United States, the entry into production of the YME project in Norway, fewer operating incidents in Peru and Trinidad and Tobago, and higher demand for gas in Venezuela.
Exploration campaign
In 2022, drilling was completed on eight exploratory wells, two of them positive (both in Colombia) and six negative
Guyana and Indonesia); plus three appraisal wells in the United States, two with positive and one with negative results. At December 31, an exploratory survey was under way in Colombia.
Acreage
A final investment decision was made in relation to one project in the US Gulf of Mexico (Castile and Leon), on Phase 3 of development at Eagle Ford in the United States, on Phase I of the Pikka project in Alaska in the United States, on the Lapa project in southeast Brazil, and on the Cypre project in Trinidad and Tobago, to make further progress in strategic projects. In Alaska, unitization of the Quoka area and of the Alignment Agreement area was settled, which meant that Repsol entered with a 49% stake in 46 blocks that belonged 100% to Oil Search.
Reserves
A total of 194 Mboe in proven reserves was added in 2022, mainly a result of extensions and discoveries, reviews and buying and selling. The total reserve Replacement Ratio was 97% in 2022 (130% in 2021).

final investment decision made on Castile and Leon, and phase three of development at Eagle Ford and Pikka.
In January and February, in the United States, new assets were acquired at Marcellus, adding approximately 45,000 net acres in Tioga, Bradford and Lycoming counties (Pennsylvania), including additional production of approximately 80 million cubic feet per day and future drilling locations.
In February, the stake in Blacktip in the Gulf of Mexico was increased to 11.3%, by absorbing a portion of Chevron’s stake following its exit from the project.
In March, an agreement was signed with the non-profit foundation MiQ (the main market standard for methane emissions performance in the United States) to obtain certification for the Marcellus Shale production in Pennsylvania. The Monument-2 delineation drilling in the Walker Ridge 271 block in the Gulf of Mexico was also completed with a positive result.
In May, the final investment decision (FID) was made to develop the Castille and Leon projects located in the Keathley Canyon extension area of the Gulf of Mexico (partners LLOG and Beacon).
In June, the FID was reached for the third phase of Eagle Ford development, which involves drilling a further 49 operated wells (on 12 platforms) that are expected to generate additional incremental lifetime net sales of 42 Mboe in the retrograde gas, wet gas and black oil windows.
In August, the final investment decision was made for development of Phase I of the Pikka project in Alaska. The project is designed with a carbon intensity index that is among the lowest in the global portfolio of assets. Production is expected to start in 2026. In December, the authorities approved the project.

In November, Shell obtained a 20% interest in eight blocks at the Walker Ridge area (blocks 4, 5, 48, 90, 91, 92, 134 and 135) in the Gulf of Mexico, spread between the Shenandoah and Sparta projects. Repsol is a partner of Shell at several prospecting wells in the Shenandoah area, including Abilene. The agreement is subject to regulator approval.
In December, Carbon-Zero, Cox, Crescent Midstream and Repsol joined forces to develop one of the most important marine hubs on the Gulf of Mexico Coast for CCUS (Carbon Capture Usage & Storage).
In December, the acquisition of new acreage was agreed with the company INPEX in the strategic area of Eagle Ford.
• Canada: sale of acreage in Alberta.
• Mexico: return of blocks and restoration of reefs.
In September, 95,000 net acres (38,000 hectares) of the Chauvin, Duvernay and Montney productive oil and gas fields in Alberta were sold to Teine Energy.
In 2022, the National Hydrocarbons Commission authorized the return of exploration blocks 5, 10, 11, 14 and 15, located in the Burgos Basin in the Gulf of Mexico. Following these withdrawals, Repsol’s presence in Mexico is limited to just block 29 in the deep waters of the Salina basin in the Gulf of Mexico, where it is an operator with a 30% stake.
In September, the reef restoration program began in Veracruz. Repsol, together with the National Commission of Protected Natural Areas of Mexico and Blue Tech/ Oceanus, A.C., began a work program for the restoration of three hectares of reef in the Veracruz Reef System National Park. The objectives include increasing healthy and genetically diverse coral colonies and rehabilitating the area’s structure and ecological functions, notably including the need to allow other species and organisms to grow and flourish there.

1 2022 Overview
Within the framework of the development works in the Caipipendi area, in Bolivia, the milestone of early connection of the MGR-10 Well was reached in June, increasing production by more than 2 Mm3/d ahead of schedule. Drilling of the well in 2021 reached a depth of 4,550 meters. The production test results confirmed the production volumes, which led to the approval of the project, with initial flows of more than 2 Mm3/d and 2,600 boe/d.
Lapa SW.
In May, Repsol Sinopec Brazil and its partners Petrobras and Equinor began 4D seismic acquisition operations (892 km2) spanning the neighboring Roncador field in the deep waters of the Campos basin.
In January 2023, the final investment decision (FID) was made on the Lapa SW block in the Santos basin. When it goes into operation in 2025, Lapa Sudoeste will increase production from the Lapa field by 25,000 barrels of oil per day.
In September, the Tejón-1 exploratory well, carried out at the CPO-9 block operated by Ecopetrol (Repsol holding a 45% stake), ended with positive results.
In October, drilling of the Cosecha GN 01 exploratory well in the Cosecha block, operated by SierraCol (with Repsol holding a 17.5% stake), was completed with positive results.
In January, the sale to New Stratus Energy of Repsol’s 35% operating interest in heavy crude blocks 16 and 67 was completed.
platform and start of development of the Cypre project.
In July, Repsol, together with BP, completed installation of the upper part of the Cassia Compression (Cassia C) platform off the east coast of Trinidad. The installation marks an important milestone in the project that will allow access to and production of low-pressure gas reserves from fields currently in production in the Greater Cassia area, thus maximizing the recovery of these existing resources. Production started in November.
In September, Repsol, together with BP, confirmed the start of development of its Cypre offshore gas project (joint development of the SEQB and Macadamia discoveries). At its peak, the development is expected to generate average gas production of 250 to 300 million cubic feet per day (mmscfd).
While the political and economic situation remains the same, the prospects for the operation have improved as a result of the incipient relaxation of the United States Government’s coercive measures against Venezuela.

In April, dismantling of the Buchan and Hannay fields was completed, achieving a recycling rate and a reuse of recovered materials of 99%. New agreements were also signed to export the oil produced at Golden Eagle, Piper and Claymore to the Flotta Repsol terminal in Scarpa Flow, Orkney, until the end of the field’s useful life in the 2030s.
In May, a team was set up to start the preliminary design and engineering study for development of the Marigold field, owned by Ithaca and Hibiscus, with the Piper Bravo platform operated by Repsol Sinopec UK (estimated maximum production of 40 Kboe/d and 12 Mscf/d).
In January, March and April, there were interruptions in production at the El Sharara Field over security concerns. lFor more information, see Note 20.3 to the consolidated financial statements).

Main events 2022 was marked by the continued recovery from the impacts of COVID-19 in the first months of the year, and later by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which led to an increase in prices in the international crude oil, gasoline and diesel markets, significantly affecting global demand and the margin of Refining and Chemicals. In this environment, the Industrial businesses adapted their production, logistics and commercial schemes to the changing situation. The volatility in demand also required the Trading activity to adapt within the Industrials value chain (chartered vessels and time- charter voyages), while Wholesale and Gas Trading was affected by unprecedented levels of volatility as gas prices continue to rise, especially in Europe, but also in North America.
The volatility in prices made it possible to capture better margins occasionally, but the war has worsened the environment in which, foreseeably, the Industrial businesses must operate, and therefore significant impairments in the value of the assets were recognized in the period l For more information, see Section 4.1 Results
All this did not put a brake on the push for further progress toward decarbonization. This can be seen in the progress made in circular economy and advanced biofuel projects at industrial complexes, with new plants for 100% recyclable polymeric materials, and in the development of renewable hydrogen being carried out by various consortiums in the Iberian Peninsula.
5.2.1. Refining
Main assets
The Repsol Group owns and operates six refineries: five in Spain (A Coruña, Bilbao, Cartagena, Puertollano and Tarragona), with a total distillation capacity of 896 thousand barrels of oil/day (including the stake in Asfaltos Españoles S.A. in Tarragona), and one in Peru, where it owns a 99.2% stake, with an installed capacity of 117 thousand barrels of oil/day.

Performance: high margins and spill in Peru
Last year was heavily affected by the international tensions arising from the war, most notably affecting Europe. Despite this environment, Repsol continued to run its business as an essential service for society and to guarantee supply in Spain.
The volatile environment resulting from these international tensions impacted the refining margin indicator, which retreated throughout 2021 and in the early months of 2022, largely due to the decline in demand for fuel. This situation promptly turned on its head in the second quarter of 2022, when international tensions and the veto on imports of raw materials and products from Russia led to a mismatch between supply and demand and, consequently, to higher world reference prices. This supply-demand mismatch was compounded by the endemic state of refining in the European Union, which has reduced its capacity by more than 10% in the last decade, mainly due to the closure of 24 facilities caused by an environment of low profitability and regulatory uncertainty. All of this ultimately fed through to the refining margin indicator, which reacted by climbing sharply to an average of $28.8 per barrel in June.

However, between July and September there was then a further decline in the refining margin index to $12.7/bbl on average, mainly due to high energy costs. In the last period of the year, volatility remained very high, with the average annual indicator of the refining margin index in Spain rising to 15.6 (4.4 $/bbl in 2021 for the same period). Meanwhile, average distillation utilization was 86% in Spain compared to movement of a vessel that was unloading crude oil at the 76% in the previous year.

In Peru, the refining margin indicator stood at 18.5 dollars per barrel, up from 6.3 dollars per barrel in 2021 as a result of efficiencies in crude purchases, low sulfur fuel oil production and pricing mechanisms in the country. The country’s performance was heavily affected by an oil spill that occurred on January 15, caused by an uncontrolled
Pampilla refinery. lFor more information, see section 6. Sustainability and Note 29.1 Environmental investment, expenses and provisions of the 2022 consolidated financial statements.
The average level of distillation in the year was 80%, compared to 96.2% in 2021, largely due to the incident, although levels gradually recovered throughout the year.

Development of cutting-edge decarbonization projects
In March, the last phase of construction began on the first advanced biofuels plant in Spain, at the Cartagena refinery. Repsol is set to invest more than €200 million in this project, which will come into operation in the second half of 2023, with capacity to produce 250,000 metric tons per year of advanced biofuels, such as hydro-biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), bionaphtha and biopropane. These can be used in aircraft, boats, trucks or cars, allowing a reduction of 900,000 metric tons of CO2 per year.
We continue to make progress on the EcoPlanta project, the first plant in Spain to recover non-recyclable municipal solid waste to circular methanol, which will be used to manufacture new materials and advanced biofuels. The project already has financing to develop it on a large scale thanks to the agreement signed with the European Commission within the framework of the Innovation Fund formalized in March. EcoPlanta is one of seven projects selected at European level, and the only one in Spain. It represents a milestone in the Company's plans, both in the decarbonization of our industrial businesses and in promoting the circular economy.

5.2.2. Chemicals
Main assets
Production at Repsol’s Chemicals business is concentrated in three petrochemical complexes, located in Spain (Puertollano, Tarragona) and Portugal (Sines), in which there is a high level of integration between basic chemicals and derived chemicals, as well as with the Group’s refining activities in the case of the Spanish complexes. Repsol owns various subsidiaries and affiliates through which it operates plants that manufacture polyolefin compounds, synthetic rubber and specialty chemicals, the latter through Dynasol, a 50% alliance with the Mexican group KUO, with plants in Spain, Mexico and China, alongside local partners.
Performance: margins and demand slipping
The performance of the Chemicals business was notably uneven throughout 2022, with a significant worsening in margins, mainly in the fourth quarter. The decline was down to a considerable decrease in demand as well as higher costs, leading to lower activity and adjustments in plant operations. Sales amounted to 2,451 Mt, down 13% on the previous year.

Differentiation and the Circular Economy
In March, Repsol entered into a partnership with Ravago, a global compounds manufacturer and recycler and distributor of polymers, under a long-term agreement for a new polypropylene compound plant for automotive applications, in Morocco. The plant, which is scheduled to start up in mid-2023, will have a manufacturing capacity of 18.5 kt/year of polypropylene compounds. It will be located in the duty free zone of Tangier and will cover local demand.
In April, following an investment of €54 million in shares and an additional €69 million in a subscription of convertible bonds, Repsol became a shareholder in Enerkem, a leader in gasification technology to obtain renewable fuels and chemical products from non-recyclable waste.
Also in April, the DYNASOL Group, Repsol's JV with the KUO group in the rubber sector, announced that it will increase its production capacity in Santander with the installation of a new line to produce styrene-butadiene rubber (SSBR). The investment will mean a 20 kt/year increase in production of SSBR in Spain (with the potential to reach 25 kt/year) and the line is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2024.
In May, an investment of €18 million in the production of high-quality polymeric polyols in Tarragona was announced, with the goal of expanding the Alcupol® range, aimed at the bedding, furniture and automotive markets. The production line, expected to be in production in the last quarter of 2023, will use in-house technology developed by Repsol.
In June, investment of €105 million was announced for construction of the first ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene plant in Spain. The plant, scheduled for commissioning at the end of 2024 in Puertollano, will use DSM technology and will have an annual production capacity of up to 15 kt. In the same month, Repsol announced that it will invest in a cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) plant in Tarragona for the manufacture of high and very high-voltage cables. With an investment of €35 million, the plant will have a manufacturing capacity of up to 27 kt/year (commissioning

scheduled for mid-2024). Finally, Repsol has inaugurated a new production line for fiberglass-reinforced compounds at the Polidux Monzón plant, Huesca, specially designed for the automotive sector.
Last but not least, in October, Repsol became a strategic shareholder of Acteco by acquiring a 27% stake in the integrated waste management and recovery company, thus strengthening its commitment to polyolefin recycling.
l For more information, see sections 6.2.4 Circular economy and 6.3 Technology and innovation.
5.2.3. Trading
The main function of Trading is to optimize the supply and marketing of the Group’s positions in international markets for crude oil and petroleum products (integrated supply chain) and its activity consists of (i) the supply of crude oil and products for Refining systems and other Group needs, (ii) the marketing of crude oil and associated products from its own production, (iii) the maritime transport of crude oil and derivative products associated with these activities, and (iv) the management of crude oil and product hedges in the financial derivative markets.
Performance: capturing opportunities as they arise
Very good results in 2022 across the main businesses, both in Crude Oil and Products, as well as in Maritime transport and Bunker, supported by the strength of our value chain and the opportunities of the volatile environment.
In 2022, 1,401 ships were chartered (1,413 in 2021) and 382 fleet voyages were made under time charter arrangements (397 in 2021).
Technological development and decarbonization
In March, Repsol and Navantia signed a collaboration agreement to develop innovative solutions jointly to decarbonize maritime transport. The behavior of the new liquid fuels with a low carbon footprint to be supplied by Repsol (advanced biofuels produced from waste and synthetic fuels) will be jointly evaluated in both the propulsion and generation engines manufactured by Navantia, The project will focus on evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of the technology.

5.2.4. Wholesale and Gas Trading
Main assets and operations
At 31 December 2022, the Group had regasification and transport assets at its North American marketing businesses, including the Saint John LNG regasification plant (formerly known as Canaport) and gas pipelines in Canada and the United States.
In the North East United States, where natural gas supply is usually restricted, cold weather scenarios can cause significant spikes in the area’s reference prices. The Company’s activity in this area focuses on optimizing the margin from the marketing and sale of regasified LNG from Saint John LNG and natural gas acquired on the market. Repsol also markets and trades natural gas in North America from its own production in the United States (Marcellus) and Canada (Alberta), together with acquisitions from third parties.
Wholesale and Gas Trading also ensures the efficient supply of the Repsol Group’s gas demands and markets and trades gas within the Spanish gas system and in the international liquefied natural gas (LNG) market.
Performance: highly volatile environment and steep gas prices
In 2022, commercial activity in the United States took place amid high prices for natural gas and LNG and extraordinary price volatility. The invasion of Ukraine has prompted many Central European countries to increase their liquefied natural gas supplies as a means of diversification. As a result, LNG exports from the United States to Europe have increased and, with it, the demand for natural gas in the US, thus pushing up natural gas prices there, as just mentioned.
LNG and natural gas marketing and trading activity in Spain was also impacted by the extreme volatility and high prices across all markets, especially in Spain and Europe. Against this backdrop, the consumption of natural gas at Repsol’s industrial complexes fell by more than 50%, with natural gas being replaced by other lower cost raw materials, thus allowing for the optimization of the marketing and sale of these surplus volumes.

Development of decarbonization projects
In the current context of high Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) prices and increasing demand, Repsol continually explores all options to maximize the value of Saint John, focusing on new decarbonization opportunities in support of the energy transition. Along these lines, the company is exploring the possible construction of a liquefied natural gas facility on the east coast to supply Europe, and the possibility of adding liquefaction capacity at Saint John is also considered a viable option.
5.2.5. Firm commitment to hydrogen
January witnessed the birth of SHYNE (Spanish Hydrogen Network), the largest renewable hydrogen consortium in Spain. It is made up of 35 companies from different sectors and will deploy projects that are expected to generate more than 13,000 jobs. Repsol is leading this initiative in line with its renewable hydrogen strategy (presented in October 2021), in which it plans to invest €2,549 million by 2030.
In April, the creation of the Ebro Hydrogen Corridor was announced, as a benchmark in developing this renewable energy. The project will bring together the Basque Hydrogen Corridor (BH2C), the Hydrogen Valley of Catalonia (H2ValleyCat), the Hydrogen Valley of Aragon “GetHyGA” and the Navarre Green Hydrogen Agenda. The main aim is to contribute to the rapid and efficient deployment of the hydrogen economy by generating an outstanding geographical area for hydrogen development in Spain.
SHYNE will be a key driver of this new industrial ecosystem and will provide valauble support to projects and promote efficient knowledge management and research into pioneering technologies to position Spain at the forefront of this new energy vector.
In July, Repsol signed a collaboration agreement with Navantia for the industrial development of renewable hydrogen. Navantia’s Turbine Factory in Ferrol (Galicia, Spain) will start up an electrolyzer production line and Repsol will contribute with its industrial capabilities to the development of the entire renewable hydrogen value chain and promote its use across different sectors as it seeks to lead this market in the Iberian Peninsula. In doing so, it will also help to achieve national and international capacity targets, set at 1.9 GW by 2030.
In September, the European Commission approved the IPCEI Hy2Use project, jointly prepared and notified by 13 Member States, which will provide up to €5,2,00 million. The project will include two of Repsol’s renewable hydrogen projects, located in Cartagena and Petronor. These projects will help promote research, large-scale industrial deployment and the construction of infrastructure for the entire renewable hydrogen value chain:

construction of an electrolyzer that will have, during phase one, a capacity of 100 MW and will help to decarbonize the industries located along the Escombreras Valley. It is estimated that this project will reduce CO2 emissions by more than 167,000 metric tons per year and create some 1,100 jobs.
Petronor, envisions the development, construction and operation of a 100 MW renewable hydrogen production plant. Production from this plant will be used to decarbonize large industrial consumers in and around the Port of Bilbao, Margen Izquierda and the surrounding area. n addition, the production of renewable hydrogen locally and through electricity generated at renewable energy facilities on the Spanish mainland, will increase the security of energy supply to all consumers who use it. The project is currently in the design and development phase and construction of the plant will begin in 2024, with the facility expected to commence production in the second half of 2025.
The electrolyzer will also supply renewable hydrogen for mobility and heavy transport decarbonization applications, through the infrastructure that will soon be installed at the Energy Intelligence Center of the Ezkerraldea-Meatzaldea Technology Park, which will be directly connected to the production plant.

commissioned by the end of 2025. An investment of €230 million is estimated for the project. In a second phase, starting in 2027, renewable hydrogen production capacity would be increased to 1 GW.
The electrolyzer will look to run on nearby renewable energy wherever possible, which it will supplement with a power purchase agreement (PPA). It will feature state-of-the-art technology to minimize water consumption for the
production of renewable hydrogen and oxygen. The renewable hydrogen will be used as an industrial fuel for local industry, including uses relating to mobility, and will be injected into the natural gas transportation network.
A hydrogen collector will also be built to transport this gas between the electrolyzer, located in the northern estate of the Petrochemical Complex, and the southern area to connect the various consumers through an open network.
The renewable oxygen will also find uses in the surrounding industry and will be distributed via the gas pipeline that already exists at the Petrochemical Industrial Park.
Repsol is also exploring new opportunities to promote hydrogen hubs in other regions of Spain, such as Galicia. A 30 MW renewable hydrogen plant will be built in 2025 on the site of the former Meirama thermal power plant (Cerceda). This capacity will steadily increase as the different phases of the complex are completed, ultimately reaching 200 MW. Repsol is collaborating with Naturgy and Reganosa on this project.

Main events
The segment's performance was the product of an environment characterized by the partial recovery from the pandemic (increased demand and activity) and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (high volatility in electricity and gas prices and measures taken by the Spanish government to mitigate its effects).
At the Mobility businesses, activity increased in a year that included the government’s fuel rebates and Repsol’s discount campaigns, which were brought forward to March, of 10 cents/liter for users of the Waylet and Solred Profesional payment platforms. This ultimately attracted more than 2 million users to the Waylet app. The development of the electric mobility charging station network Performance: recovery in activity and focus on customers also continued throughout the period, with more than 1,000 public charging stations installed by the end of 2022.
At the electricity and gas marketing business, Repsol had a portfolio of more than 1.5 million customers at the end of the period, including Gana Energía. Highlights include the agreements reached to acquire the customer portfolios of Capital Energy and Alterna and to market and sell electricity with The Phone House and Fnac, as well as the start of the marketing and sale of electricity and gas in Portugal.
At the other commercial businesses, in Lubricants, Aviation, Asphalts and Specialized Products, kerosene sales continued to improve at Aviation, following the recovery that had started in 2021, while sales were slightly down at LPG, largely due to higher temperatures.
At Renewables, highlights included the strategic agreement to dilute the 25% stake in Repsol Renovables, as well as the sale of the 49% stakes held in the Valdesolar and Kappa photovoltaic parks, both operational. Progress in the growing the business in the United States following the acquisition of new projects (Frye, Pinnington and Outpost) and, in other geographies, with the agreement to purchase 100% of Asterion Energies. Last but not least, the period saw the start-up of the first asset in the United States (Jicarilla 2) and Delta II in Spain.

5.3.1. Mobility
Assets
At December 31, 2022, Repsol had 4,651 service stations, with the following geographical distribution:
and digitalization
Fuel sales in the year at Service Stations in Spain were 10% higher than in the same period of 2021, while Direct Sales (gasoline + automotive diesel) were up 41%.
In March, Repsol became the first operator to apply a 10 cents/liter discount on fuel prices to its customers who pay through the Waylet and Solred Professional apps, thus supplementing the 20 cents/liter discount approved by the Spanish Government, which remained in effect from April 1 to December 31. As a result, the fuel price reduction reached a minimum of 30 euro cents per liter of fuel.
Following the discontinuation of the government’s discount on December 31, Repsol decided to extend Waylet's 10-cent discount until March 31, 2023. With these measures, Repsol is helping to mitigate the impact on its customers of the sharp increases in fuel prices.
In May 2022, the Fleet Management project was launched, a cloud-based product that helps professional customers make their processes more robust and efficient by centralizing, in a single platform, all the information generated by their vehicle fleets, thus cutting administrative and operating costs and reducing management time.
Also in May, Repsol signed an alliance with Burger King, whereby each Waylet payment made in its establishments generates a minimum 1.5% balance for the user, which is added to his or her digital wallet and can be discounted from future purchases.
At the end of 2022, the Waylet payment app had reached 5.5 million users, topping the table of transport apps with a 35.3% market share, while also winning the DEC 2022 Award for Best Innovation Project in June..

Electric mobility and sale of biofuels
In January, the Company signed an agreement with Uber, making Repsol an Uber-approved energy supplier for its drivers of VTC vehicles and taxis that are 100% electric or plug-in hybrids.
In 2022, an electric vehicle installation was unveiled with Nissan at the Elche service station, equipped with four ultra- fast charging points. With a power output of 50 kW, it is able to charge an electric vehicle in 25–30 minutes, depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery. The first ultra-fast charging point has also been installed in the Community of Madrid, at the Venturada service station (kilometer 49 of the A-1), which in turn has four 350 kW charging points, quick enough to charge an electric vehicle in 5–10 minutes. At December 31, 2022, Repsol had a network of more than 1,087 public charging points.
In April, the supply of biofuel began to the French Formula 4 championship, the first single-seater competition in the world to use fuel from 100% renewable sources throughout the season. l For more information, see section 6.3 Technology and innovation.

5.3.2. Lubricants, Aviation, Asphalts and Specialized Products
Assets and operations
Production of Lubricants, Asphalts and Specialized Products is mainly concentrated in Spain, although in the case of Lubricants there are two additional manufacturing hubs: Mexico, through the joint venture with Bardahl, which covers the Americas; and Indonesia and Singapore, through the joint venture with United Oil, which covers Southeast Asia. Both cover areas where the lubricants market is expected to grow the most on average over the coming years. The commercial division has a strong international component, with deliveries in more than 90 countries around the world.
Repsol markets and sells aviation fuel in various locations, most notably in Spain, France, Portugal and Peru.
Performance: recovery at Aviation
Total sales were 22% higher than in 2021, driven by the recovery of Aviation fuel sales (beginning in the second half of 2021), which were up 56% on 2021 (131% above 2020).
Decarbonization and digitalization
In April, a collaboration agreement was signed with the Spanish Air and Space Force. The agreement includes aspects such as improving sustainable mobility in the air sector, analyzing and drafting proposals to promote the development and consumption of new fuels with a low environmental impact, and joint R&D&i actions. Under this agreement, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced by Repsol from biomass was used for the first time on October 12 on occasion of the parade of the Patrulla Águila demonstration team.
In June, the first three long-haul flights, from Madrid to the United States, were successfully completed using biofuels produced in Spain from waste at the Petronor refinery, within the framework of the agreement signed with Iberia.
At the Lubricants unit, the lubricantes.repsol.com web portal was launched in November, thus meeting one of the key milestones of the business on the path to digitalization. The portal includes the MyQR tool, which will allow us to digitalize marketing campaigns for our lubricants.
Over the course of 2022, the first carbon neutral lubricant range, known as the Master range and aimed at light vehicles, was launched globally.

5 Performance of Sustainability Outlook our businesses
LPG sales in 2022 were slightly down on the previous year, mainly due to higher temperatures, although margins on regulated products followed a positive trend toward the end of the year, leading to a better result for 2022 as a whole.
Digitalization, decarbonization and customer focus
ISCC-Plus certification was earned during the year for the Puertollano facility, which will allow for the sale of Bio LPG produced by the refineries of sustainable origin. The year also witnessed the first photovoltaic plant in LPG, where the aim is to improve energy efficiency (the annual consumption of an LPG factory will come from its own solar generation).
LPG has become a perfect ally in tackling the ecological transition and is a genuine alternative for making immediate progress toward the decarbonization targets, without losing any competitiveness and taking into account the geographic and demographic circumstances of each region.
5.3.4. Retail Electricity and gas
Performance: customers and power sales both up
The business performance in 2022 took place in a complex environment. Prices and volatility in the energy markets hit all-time highs and regulatory changes fueled fierce levels of competition in the retail market.
Volumes sold at year-end 2022 amounted to 4,278 GWh of electricity (3,964 GWh in 2021) and 1,650 GWh of gas (1,586 GWh in 2021).
At year-end 2022, Repsol had 1.5 million customers in Spain —including Gana Energía— (+15% vs. 2021) and a market share of 4.15% (3.5% in 2021). This growth was achieved

thanks to a strategy based on competitive terms for new customers, taking advantage of portfolio purchase opportunities, focusing on loyalty and growing Gana Energía.
New customers and markets
In line with the strategy of harnessing portfolio purchase opportunities, in January Repsol acquired Capital Energy’s portfolio of residential and SME electricity customers, thus bringing in a further 21,000 customers. Repsol also won the sixth edition of the collective purchase of energy promoted by the Spanish Organization of Consumers and Users (OCU), thus acquiring more than 45,000 customers.
In March, Repsol entered into a partnership agreement with Caja Rural del Sur to offer electricity, gas and value-added services to customers through the bank’s 320 branches. The aim is to respond to the energy needs among customers and offer them a personalized range of products and services tailored to their consumption habits. Cajas Rurales de Aragón and Zamora would then join this agreement two months later.
In June, a pioneering alliance was launched in the Openbank sector, whereby users who arrange electricity and gas from Repsol can earn a discount of up to 10 basis points on their mortgage with the bank. The partnership with Correos (Spanish Post Office) was also extended, and Repsol products can now be marketed exclusively in all of its 2,100 offices (1,078 in 2021).
It has been selling electricity and gas in Portugal since July 2022, offering 100% renewable electricity and gas to residential customers, as well as electricity to companies, reaching almost 2,500 customers across the country.
In August, Repsol signed a double agreement with Dominion to sell electricity and gas through its Phone House plants, in Algeciras (Cadiz) and Escatrón (Zaragoza), with a channel (comprising a network of more than 500 physical stores) and to acquire Alterna’s electricity and gas customer portfolio (70,000 customers in total). In November, the Spanish Markets and Competition Commission (CNCM) gave the green light to this operation and the process of integrating these new customers got under way. This process was completed before the end of the year.
ְIn December, an alliance was signed with Fnac to offer the Company’s electricity and gas rates.
5.3.5. Low-carbon generation and renewables

The policy is implemented through the Sustainability Model, in accordance with best practices in environmental, social and governance matters, and it is structured into six pillars: climate change, environment, innovation and technology, safe and secure operation, people, and ethics and transparency.
Sustainability plans are drawn up every year, serving as public commitments in line with the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and for which the Company is accountable year after year.
The 2022 Global Sustainability Plan (GSP), which sets out 49 medium-term objectives built around the six pillars of the model, incorporates new commitments this year to the production of renewable hydrogen and the reduction of absolute CO2 and methane emissions to move towards net zero emissions.
Based on the GSP, Local Sustainability Plans (LSPs) are implemented in countries and operating centers. They incorporate annual initiatives that respond to the Company’s objectives and the needs of local stakeholders. In 2022, Repsol had a total of 19 local plans in place: 13 across its countries (Algeria, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, United States, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, Peru, United Kingdom, Libya and Venezuela) and six at its industrial facilities (Bilbao-Petronor, Cartagena, Coruña, Puertollano, Tarragona and Sines). The LSPs have led to the implementation of more than 3,000 initiatives since 2014, aligned with the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. lFor more information on the Global Sustainability Plan and Local Sustainability Plans, see www.repsol.com (Sustainability - Sustainability Strategy -Reports and KPIs - Sustainability plans).

Repsol and the Sustainable Development Goals
Committed to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development since its adoption in 2015, Repsol contributes to achieving the SDGs and works to ensure their implementation at all organizational and business levels.
Repsol focuses its efforts on SDGs 7, 8 and 13 with the aim of guaranteeing access to sustainable energy, promoting economic growth and fighting climate change. Moreover, it is committed to technological innovation, sustainable water management and the circular economy (SDG 6, 9 and 12) and it collaborates with its stakeholders and actively participates in business associations, in line with SDG 17.
Since 2019, Repsol has published an annual report which includes more than thirty indicators, projects and testimonials that show its contribution to the SDGs both globally and locally1.
Likewise, in 2022 Repsol analyzed its contribution to the SDG Roadmap for the oil and gas sector, developed by IPIECA and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and in which it played a leading role in its preparation. This document sets out the actions that companies in the oil and gas sector should undertake to help achieve a future with a low carbon footprint and a healthier and more prosperous world in line with the 2030 Agenda.
On the basis of this analysis, the degree of alignment between Repsol’s plans and the roadmap was established and improvements have been identified to continue making progress in the SDGs in the coming years.
Another major milestone was the Company’s participation in two pilot projects for the valuation of impact assessment tools of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and UNEP-FI

There is a growing demand for information from investors, analysts, shareholders and financial institutions regarding compliance with Repsol’s energy transition strategy. ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria have become increasingly relevant in recent years, such that environmental, social and good governance factors are highly valued by investors, beyond financial results.
The Company provides its main stakeholders with timely, accurate and transparent information on ESG aspects during the quarterly and annual presentation of results and strategic events. The management team also conducts specific ESG roadshows, some of which are led by the CEO himself.
The sustainability ratings prepared by prestigious entities (MSCI, S&P, Sustainalytics, CDP, among others) represent an indicator of compliance with the strategic objectives and the quality of the Company’s management and governance in this area.
The reports obtained from the roadshows and other ESG events, such as ESG Day held on October 4, 2022, are periodically presented to the Board of Directors. On this occasion, aspects about the role of technology in accelerating the energy transition were explained. Moreover, the Ecoplanta project was presented as an opportunity for a technology-driven circular economy. The main lines of work relating to diversity and inclusion, as well as Repsol’s approach to assessing the climate credentials of an energy company were also discussed.
As for ethics and transparency, the Audit and Control Committee and the Ethics and Compliance Committee are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of Ethics and Conduct in all areas of the Company.
The Company’s senior management defines the objectives, action plans and practices with regard to sustainability. To ensure that the organization is properly aligned, sustainability and decarbonization objectives accounted for 20-35% of the variable compensation of all Company employees in 2022, and 25% of the CEO’s annual variable compensation. Additionally, there is a long-term incentive for the 2022-2025 period, where 40% of the objectives are linked to sustainability. It applies to all senior management, including the CEO, and other employees.

6.1.2. Strategy Repsol’s strategy focuses on achieving net zero emissions by 2050, including all emissions from production to final consumption of the primary energy that is produced.
To define this strategy, Repsol carried out a process to identify and analyze the risks and opportunities related to the climate and the energy transition6.
Repsol considers that the energy transition should be accompanied by technological development in a series of decarbonization areas:
• Energy efficiency and the decarbonization of current
• Renewable electrification.
• Renewable liquid and gaseous fuels.
• Carbon sinks based on CO2 capture.

The strategy is translated into on plans and targets for this decade, a period with greater visibility in terms of environmental conditions. In the long term (2031-2050), Repsol uses global and regional energy demand scenarios to analyze several possible energy transition routes. They take into account the uncertainty associated with factors such as the pace of technological development, regulations or the energy needs and habits of consumers.

Reference energy scenarios Given the uncertainty with regards to the pace and direction of the energy transition in the long term, the scenario analysis based on different assumptions about changes in the energy context (demand for oil and gas, growth of renewables, changes in new technologies, climate policies, etc.) will become particularly important. In this sense, Repsol will adapt its businesses to varying future conditions, without decarbonization pathway that is based on specific business compromising its decarbonization targets. The scenario analysis should make it possible to test the resilience of the Company’s strategy to financial risks that arise from climate change and the necessary transition toward a decarbonized energy portfolio.
As a reference for its business analysis, Repsol adopted the forecasts of oil and gas demand, renewable generation growth and other macroeconomic environmental conditions from the International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios described in its World Energy Outlook 20217, since they are widely referenced in the energy sector:
• NZE (Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario): a
• SDS (Sustainable Development Scenario): a scenario
• APS (Announced Pledges Scenario): a scenario in line
It is important to note that the IEA highlights its NZE scenario as one of the many possible scenarios that can be proposed to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5°C:
In fact, the Sixth Assessment Report, AR6, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), published in 2022, includes more than 200 scenarios in line with limiting the increase in temperature to 1.5 °C by 2100, of which only 288 achieve emissions neutrality by 2050, whereas the rest do so later.
With regards to change in the demand for energy end products, Repsol considers a single scenario, determined by
Integrated Management Report 2022
1 2022 Overview
7 In the latest edition of the WEO 2022, published after the development of scenarios by Repsol, the SDS scenario has been eliminated. The APS scenario revised in 2022 is close to the 2021 SDS (+1.7°C vs. +1.65°C, respectively) since emission reduction announcements from new countries were included. A Stated Policies 2022 scenario is maintained which incorporates only the current policies established by the countries and that leads to a +2.5°C pathway that is incompatible with the Paris goals. 8 The 28 scenarios correspond to those that reach net zero emissions from the energy sector with a > 95% reduction compared to 2021.
“There are many possible paths to reach CO2e net zero emissions worldwide by 2050 and many uncertainties that could affect any of them; the NZE scenario is, therefore, one path but not the definitive one toward net zero emissions” (IEA, 2021, Net Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector).
scenario in which net zero emissions are achieved by 2050 in the global energy sector, and compatible with the temperature not increasing by more than 1.5 °C by 2100.
which allows for a 1.65°C pathway to be reached in line with the Paris Agreement goal of maintaining it “to well below 2°C”.

portfolio, prioritizing assets that are already productive as well as projects to develop profitable reserves at moderate crude oil prices, with a shorter life cycle and a lower carbon intensity. Hydrocarbon production in this period remains stable in the range 600-630 kboed, which compares with maximum production of 709 kboed in 2019. It will start to decline toward the end of the decade accompanied by a drop in demand in each scenario. During this period, a large part of the natural decline in field production will be offset by projects to develop reserves and contingent resources already discovered. Particular attention is given to reducing direct emissions from the assets, so that by 2025 methane intensity will fall below 0.2% and routine flaring emissions will decrease by 50%. In addition, for this decade CO2 capture and storage (CCS) has only been included in the Sakakemang project (Indonesia), but other opportunities are being explored.
2030 onwards has been taken into consideration than the worldwide decline envisaged in the IEA scenarios , entailing a greater contribution of lower-cost hydrocarbons in the hands of national companies in producing countries. This, meanwhile, makes it easier to reach Repsol’s decarbonization targets. In 2050, hydrocarbon production is estimated to be at 350-400 kboed (APS scenario), 250-300 kboed (SDS scenario) or less than 100 kboed (NZE scenario). This last case entails the decline resulting from the depletion of the assets that are already in operation by 2030, assuming that no new developments will have been undertaken from that date.

1990, as an intermediate step towards achieving emissions neutrality by 2050, as set forth in the European Green Deal.
Transport-related regulations will be particularly relevant to Repsol since they could lead to a very significant drop in the demand for petroleum products in the 2030-2050 period. These products would be progressively replaced by electricity in the light road transport segment (and partially in the heavy-duty segment), and by renewable fuels (advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels and hydrogen), in the latter case especially aimed at the transport segments that are most difficult to electrify (aviation, maritime and heavy road transport).
Thus, in the so-called 1.5 Tech Scenario prepared by the European Commission, the total demand for fuels in the transport sector by 2050 in the European Union would be covered by 15% conventional fuel, 25%9 electric mobility and 60% renewable fuels (including biofuels, synthetic fuels and hydrogen, all partly generated using renewable electricity as well).
Renewable liquid and gaseous fuels will be necessary for the decarbonization of the many energy uses where renewable electricity is not applicable or the most efficient option. The circular economy will also play a key role in decarbonization and the transformation of refining and petrochemicals industrial complexes, since a large part of the renewable fuels will be obtained from organic waste.

Biofuel production will reach 1.3 Mt by 2025 and 2.0 Mt by 2030, and renewable hydrogen production will reach 0.55 GWe by 2025 and 1.9 GWe by 2030. In the chemicals segment, Repsol will recycle the equivalent of 20% of its total polyolefin production by 2030.

It should be noted that the competitive position of Repsol’s industrial assets (first quartile in the EU by economic profit and market share in Spain) currently makes it easier to undertake the necessary investments for their transformation:

At the consolidated company level, the reduction in the CII is the key metric used to monitor and set targets for decarbonization toward becoming carbon neutral by 2050. This indicator includes both direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2 and Scope 3, the latter derived from the use of products obtained from the Company’s production of primary energy). Since the announcement of its first decarbonization pathway in December 2019, Repsol has raised these targets twice and today they are set at 15% by 2025, 28% by 2030 and 55% by 2040, to reach 100% by 2050, in line with the goal of emissions neutrality.

Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) Reduction targets
As for the period until 2030, the CII reduction target of 28% will be achieved by applying a broad combination of technologies and solutions. This is in line with Repsol’s vision of the energy transition, according to which both renewable electrification and renewable fuels and CO2 capture will be required, alongside with the reduction of the carbon intensity of the traditional operations:

In the SDS scenario, more than 90% of decarbonization is achieved with energy solutions and the need to offset the remaining emissions through natural climate solutions (NCS) is anticipated, given potential technological limitations in sectors with emissions that are difficult to eliminate. In the NZE scenario, offsetting with NCS would not be required since Repsol’s oil and gas production is already very low (net zero emissions are reached before 2050).
Lastly, Repsol compared its decarbonization pathway with that of the different 1.5°C scenarios of the IPCC (AR6, 2022), calculating their carbon intensity based on GHG emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O) and primary energy data (IIASA)12, to be able to compare them with Repsol’s CII reduction.
As shown in the graph, the reduction rate of Repsol’s pathway indicator declines, starting in the short term, within the variation interval of the 1.5°C scenarios of the IPCC, even when its starting point is higher due to the greater initial weight of oil and gas in its energy production. It should also be noted that in most IPCC scenarios emissions neutrality is achieved after 2050.

Allocation of capital Repsol’s allocation of capital to the different businesses responds to compliance with the decarbonization target in the different scenarios described: committing increased investments to low-carbon segments in order to mitigate risks and take advantage of the opportunities generated as a result of the energy transition.
Investment in low carbon technologies and businesses13 represents 35% of total investments in the 2021-2025 period. For the 2030-2050 period, Repsol estimates that the

allocation of capital under the different scenarios analyzed will be:
Percentage of capex in low carbon businesses out of total capex (average in the period)
Scenario consistent with APS demand
Scenario consistent with SDS demand
Scenario consistent with NZE demand
In 2030, Repsol plans to reach a capital employed of up to 45% in low-carbon businesses, a proportion that will continue to increase until 2050 at the pace of the energy transition in each scenario considered:
Percentage of capital employed in low carbon businesses out of the total

Resilience to the financial risks of climate change In order to assess the financial resilience of the strategy in terms of climate change, an economic analysis of the current and future business models has been carried out in the three scenarios based on the IEA’s forecasts. The result is shown in the following graph, in terms of net present value (NPV) variation in the different scenarios and contexts, taking the SDS scenario as the baseline:
The Company’s value does not vary significantly in the different IEA demand scenarios, between -4% and +2% for the price levels considered in each of the three, for the following reasons: • The environment of the Industrial and Commercial fuel
• For its part, the upstream business maintains value in
• The Low Carbon Generation and Electricity Marketing
The limited variation of the Company’s NPV in the three scenarios shows that the proposed strategy is resilient to the different speeds of the energy transition which are implicit in these scenarios.
businesses was considered invariable in the three scenarios, determined by the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 legislative package.

Regarding the prices in each scenario until 2030, Repsol has used its internal price pathway, framed by the references of analysts and agencies. From 2030 onwards, it has been linearly interpolated until reaching the IEA prices in 2040 in each of the three scenarios and thereafter, following that prices evolution.
The IEA estimates a deterministic price scenario in each of the demand scenarios. However, the current energy environment imposes great uncertainty on the supply- demand balance and the prices of raw materials, which adds to their inherent volatility. For this reason, for each of the three scenarios, a probabilistic analysis of sensitivity to oil, gas and refining margin prices has been carried out based on the historical variability of these indicators.
The results of this analysis are presented below, showing the P25 (25th percentile) and P75 (75th percentile) price ranges for each of the demand scenarios.
Probabilistic analysis of NPV variation
This variation in economic value is more related to the historical volatility of raw material prices than to the structural impact that the energy transition may have on these prices, but it is considered to provide useful supplementary information. In its price evolution, the IEA aims to provide a look at the impact of the energy transition on prices, calculating them from the marginal cost of production in the different demand scenarios, although other factors such as geopolitical ones are not taken into account.
Mechanisms to incentivize decarbonization Repsol has various internal mechanisms in place to promote the allocation of capital to low carbon investments, such as the internal carbon price and the methodology to gauge whether an investment is in line with the energy transition.
The Company has set an internal carbon price for making investment decisions on new projects. It applies to all investments, including cases where there is no regulated

carbon price. This has been done with the conviction that the cost of CO2 emissions will be internalized through regulatory mechanisms in all geographical areas over the time horizon of the life span of such investments. The internal carbon price14 used by Repsol distinguishes between the EU and the rest of the world. Thus, new investments in the EU are assessed at $70/t over the 2022-2025 period (or the regulated price if this is higher), rising to $100/t in 2030. In the rest of the world, in countries without more stringent specific regulation, $60/t is applied across the entire 2022-2030 period.
Internal carbon price (carbon incentive for new investments)
Furthermore, in 2021 Repsol developed its own methodology to assess whether a new investment is in line and consistent with its path towards decarbonization.
Any investment proposal submitted to the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors must include a report drawn up by the Sustainability Department that reflects its impact on the Company’s CII.
The investments can be categorized as follows depending on whether the impact is positive, neutral or negative:
• Aligned with the energy transition, when it does not affect
• Enabling the energy transition, if it has a negative impact
• Misaligned, when it does not meet the requirements of

In 2022, following the investment qualification methodology, the sustainability report was incorporated into 38 investment proposals that were submitted to the Executive Committee for approval (7 from E&P, 17 from Low Carbon Generation and 4 from Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy). Of these proposals, 61% were aligned, 33% were facilitators and 5% were misaligned.
6.1.3. Risks and opportunities
The risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition and climate change are becoming increasingly important in the medium and long term.
Repsol identifies and assesses the long-term risks associated with the energy transition and climate change from several perspectives by using its own analysis methodology. It adapts the medium-term risk assessment envisioned in the Integrated Risk Management System with the aim of extending its scope to 2050. This supplements the Group’s general risk map, (five-year horizon)and the emerging risk map (ten-year horizon) looking forward to 2030, 2040 and 2050 for climate change and energy transition risks.
• The risk analysis is based on the IEA’s three scenarios:
• The most significant climate change risks for the

Company have been identified. Thus, the taxonomy

5 Performance of Sustainability Outlook Appendices our businesses
The importance of each of the risks identified is determined by semi-quantitatively estimating their economic impact on each of the business lines and geographical areas. Each risk is considered a factor of uncertainty that may cause a deviation in the long-term economic results (2030-2050 horizon) in each of the scenarios analyzed according to the Company’s decarbonization roadmap.
On the 2030 horizon, the risk analysis reveals that the probability of suffering negative impacts from the energy transition is relatively low. In other words, the Company is prepared for even the most rapid transition scenarios thanks to its decarbonization pathway. Thus, in 2030, the Company has a very high probability of being able to harness opportunities that will completely neutralize any potentially negative impacts, as a result of its position and its long-term climate strategy compared to the rest of the sector, which places it in a favorable competitive position. Examples of these opportunities include energy efficiency, renewable electricity generation, advanced biofuels, renewable hydrogen, the circular economy and, in the medium to long term, carbon capture and storage.
In the long term (2040 and 2050), exposure to climate risks will increase, as there will be added uncertainty associated with risk factors and the scale at which these factors may materialize and opportunities can be exploited.
However, the commitment to become a net zero emissions company by 2050 and the analysis of its response to different energy transition scenarios mitigate these risks and demonstrate the company’s resilience (see the Resilience to the financial risks of climate change section, in section 6.1.2).
The exposure of all Repsol’s businesses to the various risks has been examined in detail and differentiating elements can
be seen, due to the specific characteristics of each business. The main risks, which may become opportunities through mitigation measures (see section 6.1.2, Strategy), are the following:
developed for this purpose has been updated, taking the risk classification proposed by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) as the main reference. It includes the categories of climate change risks, both those derived from the energy transition (regulatory, legal, technological, market and reputational) and the physical risks that could be exacerbated by the progress of climate change (acute and chronic). It includes a total of 17 risks classified according to their nature. Of these risks, the ten that account for most of the exposure are prioritized for subsequent analysis. These risks are prioritized by a group of the Company’s experts in strategy, markets, regulation, finances, reputation, legal affairs, technology and sustainability. They reach a consensus using the Delphi technique.

Regarding the physical risks of climate change, given the nature and location of the Company’s activities, the team of experts agrees that they are lower risk factors than those derived from the energy transition. However, and as a result of the public disclosure obligations arising from the European Union regulation (Taxonomy Regulation 852/2020), which establishes the framework to promote sustainable investment, Repsol has developed a semi- quantitative methodology to perform a detailed analysis of the physical risks of climate change in existing facilities, and especially in the new facilities that it includes in its portfolio and that meet the requirements established to be considered environmentally sustainable activities.

To carry out this long-term analysis, the global warming scenarios described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were considered: RCP 8.5, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.615, with the same time horizon as for transition risks (2030, 2040 and 2050), in each of the geographic locations of the facilities studied16: wind, photovoltaic, hydraulic power plants and certain petrochemical plants.
The climate projections being used to carry out these analyses are, among others, those of the Copernicus services (the EU’s Earth observation program coordinated and managed by the European Commission).

In view of these climatic condition forecasts (studied through the analysis of the physical variables associated with acute and chronic risk factors related to variations in temperature, rainfall, wind speed, etc.), possible impacts on these facilities are analyzed, both from the point of view of potential structural damage due to intensification of extreme weather events and the potential production losses or operational inefficiencies as a result of these events or changes in weather patterns.
Likewise, the barriers currently implemented to mitigate these risks and other possible mitigation measures that can be implemented in the future are also analyzed, in the case

that these types of events, which significantly reduce the probability of having an impact, come about.
The conclusion reached is that Repsol is more exposed to transition risks than to physical risks. However,it is taking steps to reduce exposure to all risks.
Climate change risks, both physical and transition risks, are managed and mitigated in the same way as the other risks to which the Group17 is exposed. However, the fact that they are emerging risks means that they will need to be examined in greater detail in the long term and mitigated through a long- term commitment to net zero emissions by 205018, a decarbonization roadmap through to 2050 and a 2021-2025 Strategic Plan that is already laying the groundwork for the transition in the short term.

Scope 3 emissions report
Although there are up to 15 categories of Scope 3 emissions in the oil and gas sector, most emissions come from those derived from the final use of its products. Repsol decided to link its target of reaching net zero emissions and its intermediate targets to a Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) that takes into account the energy and emissions associated with the use of fuel products derived from its primary energy production (oil and natural gas). Doing this, instead of referring to the emissions from the products it sells, makes more sense strategically and it entails a number of positive aspects:
• Hydrocarbon production is the most capital-intensive
• Energy products are bought and sold successively

• An emissions accounting system based solely on sales will
However, Repsol also considers that metrics related to Scope 3 emissions of marketed products can provide a useful complementary perspective to understand companies’ energy transition strategy. That is why this management report includes the following metrics, in addition to the Scope 3 emissions of the products obtained from its own production of hydrocarbons19 that are used for the CII:
• Scope 3 emissions of the products marketed by Repsol to
• Scope 3 emissions of all products marketed, excluding

Reduction in the Carbon Intensity Indicator
As indicated, Repsol has defined its CII in g COe/MJ as the main metric for monitoring the Company’s progress toward the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 upon achieving a 100% reduction in the CII. Moreover, it has set intermediate reduction targets of 15% by 2025, 28% by 2030 and 55% by 2040 compared to the base year (2016).

In 2022, a reduction of 9.6% was achieved with respect to the base year 2016, mainly due to the optimization of the E&P business asset portfolio, together with the continuation of the energy efficiency plans, the management of methane emissions in E&P operated assets and the growth in installed renewable capacity.
The numerator of the CII shows the emissions generated by the Company’s activities (direct and indirect emissions, Scope 1 and Scope 2, derived from E&P and Refining and
Reduction in absolute Scope 1+2 emissions
Repsol aims to reduce its emissions from operated assets by 55% by 2030 compared to 2016.
This commitment focuses on Scope 1 emissions (those produced by sources directly controlled by Repsol) and Scope 2 emissions (associated with the purchase of electricity, heat, cooling or steam consumed by Repsol).
Today, the Company has already undertaken initiatives with which it has achieved a 37% reduction in emissions through portfolio optimization, energy efficiency measures, reduction of methane emissions and reduction of gas flaring in the E&P business, and recovery of flare gases in the Industrial business.

Chemicals, and from Electricity Generation), as well as Scope 3 emissions generated by the use of fuel products derived from primary energy production (oil and natural gas) and the displacement of emissions from the fossil mix through renewable energy substitution. The denominator shows the energy that Repsol makes available to society in the form of end products derived from the production of primary energy from oil and gas and from low carbon energy sources20.
In addition to the CII reduction targets, and in response to the demands of its stakeholders, the Company has set two new targets based on its absolute emissions. In October
2021 the company announced for the first time, its targets for reducing absolute emissions, Scope 1+2 of operated assets and for net emissions under Scope 1+2+3:
Absolute Scope 1+2 emissions
Mt CO
Reduction in net absolute Scope 1+2+3 emissions
The target of reducing these emissions, which make up the CII numerator, by 30% compared to the base year of 2016, has been established.

CO e emission reduction plan
Repsol has multi-year emission reduction plans (Scope 1 and 2) that envision various measures to improve operational efficiency. These plans were launched in 2006 and remain in force today. A plan for the 2021-2025 period is underway, with the aim of achieving an additional reduction of 1.5 Mt CO2 by 2025, which includes, among others, electrification projects, energy integration of units, process optimization, operation efficiency of the facilities and reduction of methane emissions. In 2022, Repsol achieved a reduction of 0.34 Mt CO2e. In energy terms, this is equivalent to a reduction of 3.1 million GJ.
In 2020, UNEP launched the OGMP 2.0 initiative, which already involves more than 80 signatory companies throughout the entire gas value chain (from production to distribution).
With this commitment, Repsol began deploying different technologies in its operated assets, combining measurements at the source and aerial level (especially drones and light aircraft), to confirm the measurements detected at ground level.

In October 2022, the International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) published its second report, and Repsol again obtained the Gold Standard from UNEP for its report and implementation plan. This indicates that the Company is well on its way to achieving the goal of reporting under the Gold Standard for all its operated assets by 2023 and non operated assets by 2025.
Reduction target
Repsol aims to reduce the methane intensity to 0.20% by 2025 at its operated E&P assets. This value is recognized as near zero for the oil and gas sector by international organizations such as the UNEP, and it is consistent with the commitment recently announced by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), of which Repsol is a member.

This year there has been a greater decrease in methane intensity due to the addition of divestments of carbon- intensive asset to the reduction initiatives.
Reduction of routine flaring
The progressive reduction of routine gas flaring is key to the E&P business. That is why Repsol, in June 2016 joined the World Bank’s Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative, which brings together governments, oil and gas companies and international development organizations.
Repsol also set an intermediate target of achieving a 50% reduction in CO2e emissions from routine gas flaring activity by 2025 at its operated E&P assets and with 2018 as the baseline year, along with specific action plans to achieve it.
In 2022, the volumes of hydrocarbons sent for routine flaring decreased very significantly due to the additional contribution of divestments in Malaysia and Ecuador, exceeding the target set for 2025.

6.2. Environment
Repsol is committed to protecting the environment and the sustainable use of resources. For this reason, it prioritizes the necessary actions to prevent and minimize the potential impacts of both its operations and the products and services it offers to its customers, and it encourages measures that promote the protection of natural capital.
These commitments were reaffirmed this year through the approval of a specific environmental policy for the first time in the Company. This policy reflects the commitments to protection and preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, the sustainable management of water resources, the preservation of air quality, the fight against climate change and the application of the principles that govern the circular economy, extending all these commitments to the entire value chain. The circular economy fosters the optimization of natural resources and proper waste management, following the principles of the management hierarchy, reducing waste or, when this is not possible, giving it a second life in its own processes or in third-party processes by reusing and recycling it.
Repsol implements certification, verification and assurance processes through internal and external audits to ensure proper compliance with current regulations. Moreover, it addresses voluntary processes, such as the certification granted by AENOR to Repsol’s 100% Circular Strategy, which are a sample of its commitments to society and the environment, beyond those that are strictly regulated.
6.2.1. Air quality
Repsol is aware of the importance of protecting air quality for society and the environment. That is why one of the commitments of the new Environmental Policy promotes “applying the latest technologies to minimize air emissions from both our operations and from the products we manufacture”, using the most demanding standards to achieve this.

Air quality is mainly affected by the concentration of pollutants caused by combustion. It is determined by the energy mix, the size and density of populations, meteorological conditions, etc. Air quality management focuses mainly on emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (Nox) and particulate matter and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
To control air emissions, Repsol closely monitors the conditions under which its operations are carried out. Its industrial facilities have a network of continuous measurement systems and immission cabins (shared with the authorities) that allow the composition and levels of atmospheric emissions to be continuously measured and analyzed, with the results being sent to the environmental authorities for monitoring and control.
To cite a specific example, in 2022, Repsol continues to lead the Air Quality Observatory initiative at Camp de Tarragona (Spain) and collaborate with the Chemical Business Association of Tarragona, with technical support from scientific institutions such as the Universitat Rovira i Virgili and the Eurecat Technological Center of Catalonia in Tarragona. The entity is coordinated by the Institut Cerdà which aims to provide an ongoing assessment of air quality in the cities and neighborhoods of Camp de Tarragona to improve the environment and the sustainability of the region.
Minimization of emissions from operations Emissions from processes are continuously minimized through the implementation of the best technologies available. This includes low NOx burners (DLN technology), vapor recovery units or particulate abatement systems. In addition, and in order to control and minimize fugitive emissions, periodic Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) campaigns are carried out and high sealing systems are installed to prevent the leakage of volatile organic compounds.
Minimization of emissions from products The commitment to air quality goes beyond operations, as Repsol is constantly working to expand the range of products offered that generate lower emissions when used by customers. For example, renewable energy for mobility, advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, renewable hydrogen, LPG, ad-blue, Autogas, LNG or specific gas oils for state-of-the-art boilers, among many others.

6.2.2. Natural capital and biodiversity
Repsol and natural capital
Natural capital is defined as the inventory of both renewable and non-renewable natural resources. Through ecosystem services, it provides benefits to people by contributing to their well-being, the development of society and progress in the world economy, and it does so in the form of energy, materials supply, cultural aspects, etc. Repsol, like other companies, depends on natural capital and generates both positive and negative impacts through its operations. Therefore, conservation and protection are key factors in achieving sustainable development and ensuring that the benefits provided by these ecosystems, and specifically biodiversity, are safeguarded for present and future generations, in line with the commitments of the Environmental Policy.
In the scope of natural capital, Repsol has adopted a unique approach that makes it possible to quantify and value from an economic point of view the services provided by ecosystems in general, and biodiversity in particular, which makes it easier to include them in management decision- making. This approach is especially relevant, since it provides a new way of understanding the Company’s relationship with nature and the related risks and opportunities, with the ultimate goal of guiding actions for its protection.
To this end, Repsol developed the Global Environmental Management Index (GEMI3) methodology, which comprehensively assesses the environmental impacts of projects and operations globally, and it has implemented it as a digital solution (READS4). In 2022, new functionalities were added and implemented to cover the entire energy sector. Thus, it covers all the Company’s activities throughout the entire value chain.
READS helps to advance management by providing key indicators for the economic analysis of the impacts of projects and assets on biodiversity and ecosystem services, climate change, water resources and well-being.
In 2022, Repsol has modeled all types of facilities in the READS tool, which has made it possible to obtain an analysis of its portfolio with natural capital criteria and thus understand the impacts, in order to develop and prioritize specific action plans.

In 2022, Repsol assessed its dependence on natural capital as a company and the ecosystem services it provides. To carry out the analysis, it used the ENCORE methodology5, developed by Natural Capital Finance6 in collaboration with UNEP-WCMC. Among other things, it allows the risks and opportunities associated with the dependencies on natural capital to be assessed, with the ultimate goal of managing them properly. The following table summarizes the results obtained:

All economic activity, in the same way that it produces impacts (positive or negative) on natural capital, also has dependencies on ecosystem services generated by that capital. This table contains a summary of the dependency analysis carried out in 2022 (see text) using the ENCORE tool5. Only the dependencies (rows) for the representative economic activities in each of Repsol Group’s main business lines (columns) are included, without taking into account the dependencies with a “low” or “very low” level according to the results provided by ENCORE. Each business line will show dependency on a given ecosystem service provided that at least one of the economic activities of that business line has this dependency.
Biodiversity protection and conservation in all our activities
One of the main assets of natural capital is biodiversity. This term encompasses not only ecosystems and their living components, but also the ecological processes that sustain them and the valuable offer of services on which society depends.
In December 2022, during the United Nations COP15 High- Level Segment on Biodiversity was established the commitment of the signatory countries to undertake a coordinated global action “to stop the loss of biodiversity by 2030 and to achieve the goal of living in harmony with nature by 2050”. Repsol, through IPIECA, is working to establish a Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) together with IUCN, with traceable targets and goals to halt the current decline in biodiversity and guarantee its conservation and recovery.

As an energy company with a clear commitment to a sustainable world, Repsol plans and develops its projects and operations, regardless of their location, bearing in mind biodiversity conservation and protection, as well as the mitigation of the impacts7that may arise. To do this, it applies the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore and offset) throughout the life cycle of its operations, and especially in protected areas. This commitment has been embodied in the new Environmental Policy published in 2022.
Likewise, and fully aware of the positive role that companies can play in finding solutions to the challenges regarding the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, Repsol develops its management practices according to the following principles:

Repsol has internal environmental management regulations that envisage the performance of environmental, social and health impact assessments (ESHIA) for all new operations or facilities (even when not required by local legislation).
According to this regulation, and considering the pre-existing environmental baseline, risks and impacts on biodiversity are assessed from the design phase to the decommissioning of each project, advanced assessment and monitoring procedures are developed in areas where biodiversity is especially sensitive, and appropriate mitigation measures are defined.
This information is used to draw up biodiversity action plans (BAPs), which are developed at sites and operations located in areas that are sensitive in terms of biodiversity.
Described below are some of the main protection and restoration activities8, along with other actions related to biodiversity management that are carried out by Repsol in 2022. It should be noted that independent and competent legal bodies have overseen the standards and methodologies used in each case.

6.2.3. Water
To have integrated water
Water, a key element in energy management Water and energy are intrinsically connected. Water is used in industrial processes, factories and in hydrocarbon upstream activities. For this reason, the strategic and joint management of water and energy resources is key.
In this regard, Repsol, as an energy provider, is committed to carrying out sustainable water resource management, promoting the search for new solutions to optimize water use, guaranteeing the reduction of freshwater withdrawal and promoting measures to increase internal and external reuse as well as to preserve the quality of the receiving environment, as stated in the new Environmental Policy.
In 2022, Repsol reinforced its commitment to address global water challenges by endorsing the CEO Water Mandate, an initiative led by the United Nations Global Compact. This mandate offers a unique platform to share best practices and establish multi-stakeholder partnerships to address challenges related to scarcity, quality, governance, and access to water and sanitation.

Interactions with water as a shared resource Most of the water withdrawn by Repsol comes from the ocean (77%) and is used for cooling processes. The remaining water comes from different sources: from third parties (13%), mainly public water network suppliers, from surface water sources (5%), production and flowback water (3%); and from groundwater sources (2%).
Of the total water withdrawn, 19% is freshwater and only 0.6% of this freshwater comes from regions with high or extremely high water stress levels.
The main use of the withdrawn water is for industrial cooling process. It is also used to produce steam or be incorporated into industrial processes, in drilling activities and, to a lesser extent, to supply sanitation networks, firefighting systems and cleaning services.
In terms of water discharge, the main destination is the ocean (95%). Other minority destinations for effluents are surface water bodies (3%) or their transfer to third parties for effluent treatment or final disposal (2%).
Repsol promotes optimization and circularity in the use of water at all facilities. That is why in 2022 19 Mm3 of water were reused internally, 25% of the total incoming water, excluding that water withdrawn for once-through cooling processes in combined cycle power plants and produced and flowback water. By implementing this type of responsible water reuse practices, it has been possible to reduce the withdrawal and dependence on natural environment and its potential impacts.
Strategic action lines for 2025 For several years, Repsol has been working on a series of strategic lines in water management that are based on the analysis of its main risks and the implementation of specific
Integrated Management Report 2022

actions to minimize the impacts, on the incorporation of its real economic value in decision-making, and on promoting a responsible water culture in the Company.
In this sense, efforts are being made to define and implement improvement action plans in the different business areas until 2025. Specific targets are set in some selected cases, and regular monitoring of key performance indicators is carried out at each facility or operational center.
Analysis and management of water risks Given that water is used throughout the life cycle of projects and activities, it is essential for Repsol to have the Repsol Water Tool (RWT), which allows it to identify and minimize associated risks.
The RWT was developed in 2013 to identify and assess the main water-related risks to which operations are exposed. Its analysis methodology takes into account both internal factors (measurement level, types of use, quality treatment, withdrawal sources and discharge receptors) and external factors (future availability, regulatory changes and reputational aspects).
RWT was fully updated in 2022 to incorporate functionalities such as exposure to the risk of water stress9 and the option to calculate the value of water price10 based on the risks associated with quantity and quality, which allows this value to be used in the economic analysis for strategic decision making.
Once its analysis criteria was updated, the scope of risk calculations has been expanded to include new businesses and operations, in order to identify those centers or critical assets where greater effort must be made to mitigate risks by prioritizing and implementing improvement programs.

Minimization of impacts The main potential impacts derived from the use and water consumption in operations are related to withdrawal and the consequent reduction of availability in the environment. Regarding discharges, there may be potential impacts with the possible decrease in quality in the receiving bodies.
To carry out proper identification and monitoring, a series of specific tools are applied, including:
• Environmental, social and health impact assessments,
• Analysis of the impacts and dependencies of Upstream
• Analysis of the product life cycle, including the water
• Water footprint studies, such as the Blue Certificate of the

Managing the impacts derived from the use of water at Repsol takes into account both compliance with legal requirements that affect operations and internal standards developed according to the best international practices and recommendations published by IOGP, IPIECA, CONCAWE or other governmental agencies in which the Company participates.
Collaborative approach to water management To promote an integrated water resource management, it is necessary to adopt a participatory approach that involves all users, water planning authorities and water government agencies at all levels.
For Repsol, it is important to establish relationships with all stakeholders involved in water management, including regulators, and taking their needs and interests into account. This approach leads to more effective management strategies to help prevent risks and mitigate impacts in each river basin where it is present.
Examples of collaboration with stakeholders with regard to water include:
• Participation in sectorial working groups at associations
such as IPIECA, CONCAWE, AOP, CEFIC and FEIQUE. In the case of IPIECA, specifically in the water risks and opportunities working group, one of the initiatives in 2022 involved validating the accuracy and usefulness of the global flood and drought risk identification tools vs using local data. The aim is to determine whether these global

In 2022, freshwater withdrawal increased by 18%, mainly due to an increase in Refining and Low Carbon Generation production (use of water for once-through cooling) and for carrying out drilling campaigns in E&P North America. On the other hand, non-freshwater withdrawal dropped 4% due to a decrease in the extraction of produced water from E&P after divestment of assets. This reduction offsets the increase in seawater withdrawal in Low Carbon Generation for once-through cooling.

6.2.4. Circular economy11
In recent decades, the industrialization of emerging economies and the accelerated production and consumption models of developed countries have led to unparalleled growth in demand for resources. The link between economic development and the consumption of raw materials, the basis of the linear economy, represents an unsustainable model over time.
The risks of a linear economy are not only associated with resource scarcity, with the problems involved in sourcing the supply chain or the impact on the price of commodities, but also with growing waste generation with a high environmental impact on ecosystems.
Given this scenario, the circular economy emerges as a new production and consumption model that promotes maintaining a balance between the preservation of the planet and economic development.
Since 2016, Repsol has promoted the circular economy, not only as a key lever in the industrial transformation and decarbonization process, but also as a clear reflection of its duty to preserve the environment. In 2022, the new Environmental Policy reinforces Repsol’s express commitment to the principles of the circular economy.
Repsol applies the circular economy in all the countries in which it operates and throughout its value chain. This encourages extending the life of products, optimizing the use of resources, reducing the consumption of raw materials and reusing waste, giving it a new life or recycling it to turn it into new products.
The Company relies on the Repsol Technology Lab to apply circularity to its production processes and to the products it offers to society. Moreover, it works closely with partners, suppliers and customers, generating synergies and partnerships that allow progress to be made in technological developments and the implementation of projects.
To this end, it analyzes circular raw materials and technological pathways that progressively reduce the use of fossil fuels: municipal solid waste, organic waste, residual plastics, biogas, renewable hydrogen, CO2, etc.
In the framework of its strategic objectives, Repsol will:
• Process 4 Mt of waste by 2030.
• Reach low carbon biofuel production capacity of 1.3 Mt by
• Recycle the equivalent of 20% of its polyolefin production

Production of renewable hydrogen at refineries and petrochemical plants Repsol has recently proposed an ambitious renewable hydrogen development strategy with objectives set at 550 MWeq in 2025 and 1,900 MWeq in 2030. To succeed, more mature electrolysis technologies that allow for early development will be needed, as well as disruptive technologies to improve the efficiency of the process over the medium term. Repsol Technology Lab is working on both time horizons.
With regard to more mature technologies, such as alkaline electrolysis and Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM), efforts in 2022 have focused on selecting the most suitable technologies and their use in industrial applications for projects that are expected to be launched over the short and medium term. At the same time, we continue looking for new solutions that allow us to improve the efficiency and the investment costs of both technologies, seeking to implement said technologies in medium- and long-term projects.
In addition, a project subsidized by the Center for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI) program Misiones (Missions) called Zeppelin has been developed in collaboration with companies and technology centers such as Técnicas Reunidas, Naturgy, Aqualia, Reganosa, Redexis, Norvento, and Perseo Biotechnology to explore different alternatives for the production of renewable hydrogen from waste.
Work also continues on initiatives for the development of disruptive technologies capable of improving the efficiency of the renewable hydrogen production process. One such initiative has turned into a consortium of Spanish companies for the development and scaling of SOEC technology (solid oxide electrolyzer cells), being submitted to two national calls for public aid (PERTE H2 and "Misiones" - "Missions" 2022).
The second initiative, based on photoelectrocatalysis technology, was developed in 2021 through the spin-off Sunrgyze, together with the company Enagás . During 2022, we have continued supporting Sunrgyze in its optimization and scaling so that it can be implemented in a demo plant that will start up in 2025 at the Puertollano refinery, for which an European aid was received under the Innovation Fund (Small Scale) call.

Cybersecurity The progress made toward digitalization certainly brings great benefits. However, as the use of new technologies and their capabilities increases, so do the risks derived from their exposure in cyberspace, the reliance on the systems deployed and the information generated at the Company.
The risks are not only technical but also business-related and may take the form of operational disruptions, theft of intellectual property or sensitive information, fraud, etc. Exposure to these risks has increased with the international pandemic and the mass use of online working and remote connections. The war in Ukraine and its overflow to cyberspace has also meant an increase in the level of alertness maintained since the start of the war especially for the energy sector.
Even so, in 2022 Repsol did not encounter any relevant incidents for which it was necessary to trigger the crisis management model for cyber-attacks or business continuity due to the massive unavailability of information systems.
To mitigate these risks, the Strategic Plan and the Cybersecurity Operating Model promote the concept of information system resilience (in all aspects: management IT, industrial IT, digital environments, cloud environments, data, etc.) and the operations that support and strengthen the resources assigned to cybersecurity This model is constantly being adapted and reinforced.

6.4.1 People-centered and just transition
For Repsol, the energy transition can only be understood if it includes the principles of efficiency, sustainability, and fairness and it must be achieved with solutions that minimize the social and economic impact on workers, local communities, and society in general always being based on. respect for human rights and paying special attention to the most vulnerable groups of people.
As an integrated, multi-energy company, Repsol is diversifying its business portfolio by creating jobs in low carbon activities, investing in new energy sources, and improving processes through technologies that help reduce and neutralize emissions.
Repsol recognizes the need to collaborate with key players from the public and private sectors and society in general to achieve a just transition. In addition, the Company actively participates in different forums, such as IPIECA and The Council for Inclusive Capitalism, with the aim of sharing best practices and expert knowledge.
6.4.2 People management
Repsol's management and organization of people is a way to respond to the challenge of transforming the business to advance in terms of the energy transition and to achieve net- zero emissions before 2050. This challenge will be achieved by boosting people's development with the help of committed leaders who inspire and promote the employees' professional development so that they can be main players in this transformation, with talent management aimed at responding quickly to business needs and change management that involves digitalization, new ways of working, and the deployment of agile and flexible organizations. All of this, of course, must be done while taking care of people and ensuring their commitment, well- being, diversity, and inclusion.

Leading to transform For Repsol, leadership is a key strategic pillar in the process of the energy transition and cultural evolution. Repsol is investing its efforts in analyzing what leaders need in order to deploy training and support programs so as to promote the type of leadership that the strategy requires.
Promote inspirational leadership
Leaders play a crucial role in talent management by engaging employees so that they achieve business objectives, generating a sense of purpose, and driving and facilitating continuous development.
During 2022, a leadership survey was carried out to identify and assess the strengths and areas for improvement of our leaders (2,700 people) based on the Company's leadership model, after which an individual development plan was defined. The results were very favorable, as reflected in the external benchmark,1 placing Repsol's leaders in the first quartile when compared to the market (84% vs. 81% of the market).
In order to accompany new leaders and boost their growth at such an important time in their careers, Repsol launched a flash mentoring program in 2022, the first edition of which had 122 senior leaders mentoring newly promoted leaders.
Promoting entrepreneurial leadership
Repsol needs an entrepreneurial leader who is capable of identifying and promoting the needs for change in the areas he/she is responsible for, likewise being able to guide teams towards the challenges of the transformation at hand.
In 2022, the LEAD training program concluded. This is a program which, for the last three years and with the participation of around 1,800 leaders from all over the world and an NPS2 of 77.17%, has focused on promoting transformative and inspiring leadership by developing the skills if prioritization, communication, digitization, and innovation. It has become as a disruptive proposal with excellent results that has received external recognition, such as the gold medal for the best leadership development program by Brandon Hall.3
During 2022, renewal of our management structure continued in order to accelerate Repsol's evolution (17 departures, 49 moves, 8 appointments, and 2 new additions to the Executive Committee).

Transforming to advance The 2021-2025 Strategic Plan envisions a new company operating model in which the organization and the way of working must evolve in order to streamline decision-making, improve efficiency, and champion innovation. In this plan, a different, anticipatory approach to talent management is key in order to respond to business needs.
Deploying an agile and adaptable organization
The Company's transformation involves adopting a more integrated and efficient operating model, supported by a more agile, flatter organization with greater adaptability. To this end, in 2022 Repsol continued with its process of evolving and transforming in terms of the different units' operating models and organization.
For example, in Upstream, the Excellence Centers4 have been consolidated, concentrating support for the central areas to the business units and adapting the organization to the entrance of a new partner. In the Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy Division, a new operating and organizational model has been implemented that lays the foundations for new growth platforms in businesses and multi-energy and decarbonized assets. In the Customer Division, a new transformational phase has been embarked upon to advance in the challenge of offering multi-energy solutions adapted to the needs of each customer. In the Low-Carbon Generation and Carbon areas, the organization has been adapted to the current context and the entry of a partner. And in the Corporate Areas, the optimization and efficiency process has continued, consolidating the Global Services model while transformation processes have been undertaken in the Legal, Tax, Digital, and IT areas.
Within this context of evolution, the simplification and flattening of the organizational structure has continued, improving the ratio of employees per manager from 5.9 in 2021 to 6.4 in 2022.
Promoting change in ways of working
Repsol faces the challenges of making the way teams and people work evolve to be more efficient, promoting collaboration, innovation, and digitization, and adapting to a hybrid and flexible work environment.
During 2022, Repsol undertook an alliance with Microsoft to design and implement the Microsoft Viva Insights5 tool in the Company. This technological solution allows for obtaining key data and analytics on how people work and how they use digital tools.

Additionally, a support program was launched to achieve efficient work in a hybrid and flexible working environment. Its objective, initially, is to integrate the new ways of working into the teams in order to improve efficiency through optimal corporate objectives thanks to their development inside the management of individual time and collaboration, facilitating well-being and the reconciliation of people's personal and professional life and reinforcing team cohesion. Based on diagnosis of the current situation, an action plan is generated with specific objectives to improve the adoption of new ways of working.
Anticipatory talent management
Anticipatory talent management is essential to ensure that the Company has the talent it needs when it needs it. The development and reinforcement of existing talent together with the attraction of new profiles are the two key pillars to achieve a human team capable of facing present and future challenges.
Repsol is working to promote ongoing strategic planning and anticipation of the talent needs in the different businesses delving deeper into the use of data analytics for people management. Thus, the development of digital tools for the projection of talent needs and for the analysis of the main people management indicators has allowed the Company to model various scenarios, to analyze voluntary turnover data, to focus on talent renewal and the loyalty of critical team members, and to establish a roadmap of the types of profiles and resources necessary to fulfill the growth strategy.
New methodologies have been developed and applied to identify key positions that, due to their impact or uniqueness, and mobility. will make an essential contribution to achieving Repsol's strategy. Along with this process, a successor identification process is being deployed in order to more accurately diagnose the available talent and draw up action plans to go along therewith.
Talent attraction
In order to face the challenge of being a multi-energy company, Repsol must be able to identify and attract specific and innovative talent profiles that allow the Company to respond to the needs of the changing context of its business activity -- without neglecting the talent it needs to guarantee the efficiency and safety of all operations.
To do this, during 2022 Repsol hired 1,313 people with permanent contracts, of which 14% corresponded to strategic profiles that expand knowledge in emerging disciplines such as hydrogen, industrial optimization, solid waste management, and the circular economy -- thus contributing to the transformation of the industrial sector. In line with the "Primera Ola Digital" ("First Digital Wave") Program,6 key profiles specializing in big data, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity were added.

the competencies of the technical studies program. At the same time, the definition of specialist positions continued,8 totaling more than 60 in different areas.
At Repsol, training is a key to development. To this end, training plans are designed that respond to the needs linked to the company's strategic challenges, all with an increasing focus on sustainability and the development of new, low- carbon businesses.
Examples of this are training in the energy transition and green exploration for the Upstream business (covering topics related to hydrogen, geothermal energy, and the capture, storage, and use of CO2), as well as training in industrial safety and renewable energy for the Industrial Transformation and Circular Economy Division (dealing with issues such as the hydrogen value chain and the storage of renewable energy and its relevance in the energy transition). In addition, all service station employees participated in a program on the sale of electricity and gas.
Additionally, awareness was reinforced of the importance of data-based management and decision-making. During 2022, 1,136 people received online training and 480 started face-to- face programs within the context of the Repsol Data School, a learning program that improves the knowledge and analytical skills of employees.
Key talent retention
Given the competition for key talent on the labor market in 2022, Repsol acted quickly by developing new, more flexible compensation formulas that help retain the talent that is needed and even attract new key talent for new businesses and operations, doing so without harming internal equity between employees. In this way, more individualized compensation formulas have been developed, such as retention bonuses, premiums for expertise or critical specific knowledge, success bonuses for results, etc.
In addition, in high-demand labor markets such as that of renewable energy, case-specific salary measures have been taken to ensure the attraction and loyalty of strategic talent.
Taking care of people to prosper Repsol knows that its employees are the main players in the transformation that the Company is undergoing and is working with the firm commitment to manage them in a sustainable way that is focused on their wellbeing and fair and inclusive treatment.
Satisfied and committed people
Repsol is convinced that a motivated and committed team is the key to succeeding in the challenges it faces. The Company is in a continuous process of updating and improving its value proposition for employees, doing so from a perspective that guarantees the generation of resilient teams which are prepared to face challenges – guaranteeing sustainable employment, proper working and remuneration conditions, and a continuous dialog with workers.

Active listening to employees
For Repsol, employees' opinions are important, and for this reason the Company periodically launches a global culture survey, as well as different perception surveys on topics of general interest. This is done in order to measure employee perception.
The 2022 culture survey (79% participation) obtained an average favorable score in all the survey questions of 71%, exceeding the target defined in the Strategic Plan (70%). Among the most positively ranked aspects, it is worth highlighting our employees' sense of belonging and their recognition of Repsol as a good place to work (80% favorable score).
Fair, flexible, and variable compensation
Repsol has built a full compensation model based on fair remuneration and components that contribute to people's well-being as a crucial part of the Company's value proposition to employees. This approach aims to offer a competitive and attractive system.
In general, full compensation includes the base salary, short- and long-term variable remuneration, and a set of benefits (pension plans, healthcare, life and disability insurance, stock plan, among others).
In addition, Repsol's full compensation model promotes the Company's sustainability strategy by linking the variable remuneration of leaders and employees with strategic objectives and the sustainable transformation of the business. Examples of this are the inclusion of sustainability and decarbonization criteria in the annual variable salary and long-term incentive for the CEO (such as an increase in renewable generation, a reduction of intensity in terms of carbon, and growth in low-carbon businesses).
Regarding pay equality, Repsol carries out continuous and transparent monitoring to ensure internal equity and outward competitiveness at each location, and therefore efficiently meet the requirements of each country.
The compensation policy is continuously adapted to ensure that talent is attracted and retained. In 2022, in a context of higher-than-normal inflation and with a labor market featuring increasing mobility, the remuneration of employees was improved through an increase in the fixed salary, adapting it depending on the collective and on the realities of each country.
Work-life balance and flexibility
We at Repsol are aware that work-life balance and flexibility are fundamental elements on the current labor market; thus, these good practices are continuously promoted worldwide through ongoing programs, initiatives, and informational campaigns to raise awareness and promote a culture that strives towards work-life balance, digital disconnection, and flexible working hours.

Aside from teleworking, many countries have established flextime, whereby employees can adjust their workplace entry and departure times to ensure a healthier work-life balance. This system is in operation in Brazil, Canada, the USA, Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Indonesia, Luxembourg, and Norway. In addition, many countries have adapted their work schedules during the week so that their employees have Friday afternoons off.
Throughout 2022, in countries whose local law does not include provisions to this end (Bolivia, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela), numerous work-life balance benefits were extended to the LGTBI+ collective, which makes it easier for people in this group to access leave for marriage, maternity, and/or paternity and allows them to be included on the health insurance of their partners.
Diversity and equal opportunities
Repsol considers diversity a fundamental part of its corporate culture and of the just transition and, for this reason, it works to promote the integration of different profiles, as well as to raise awareness regarding inclusion and respect.
In this regard, Repsol continues to work towards its target of 35% of women in leadership positions by 2025, after having achieved 32.2% in 2022 (31.4% in 2021). The figures are improving year after year, working to attract female talent and make it more visible. This is evidenced by the fact that in 2022, 47% of external hires were women -- something which has contributed to positioning Repsol as a diverse and inclusive company.
Repsol is a company committed to hiring people with disabilities, aiming to eliminate the barriers that hinder their inclusion. In Spain, it exceeds the legal requirements of the General Law on Disability,9 as 2.16% of the Company's employees have a degree of disability greater than 33%. The total number of employees with disabilities in the countries where Repsol is present amounts to 486. In 2022, a collaboration agreement was signed with Down Spain to promote the occupational inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities through hiring at service stations.
To achieve a more inclusive environment for the LGTBI+ collective, different internal awareness activities have been developed, including the development and offering of the "Energía con Orgullo" ("Power with Pride") training. The Proud at Repsol Group10 has grown and it now has more than 200 people in 10 countries.

Social dialogue
As part of the commitment to manage people in a responsible and sustainable manner, freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining are part of Repsol’s culture.
Collective bargaining in Spain, where 72.31% of the group’s employees are based, is best exemplified by the Framework Agreement. Entered into with the most representative trade unions, it includes overarching labor issues that are later transferred to the collective bargaining agreements of the companies included within its scope. In September 2022, Repsol signed the X Framework Agreement, which includes (among other relevant issues) new teleworking formulas and salary increases for agreement employees, taking into account the current market and the inflationary context, internal equity, and value contribution. By signing this agreement, the Company reaffirmed its commitment to people while guaranteeing the sustainability of industrial employment, salary competitiveness, and an attractive offer for its employees.
On the international scene, Repsol has employees under collective bargaining agreements in Spain, Peru, Portugal, Brazil, Indonesia, France, Italy, and Norway, all represented by an internal body or by an industry-wide trade union. Of the total number of employees from these countries, nearly 85.91% of them were covered by a collective bargaining agreement in 2022, representing more than 79.44% of the Group's total workforce.
Since 1997, Repsol has had a European Works Council — a body for information, consultation, and communication on issues that may affect the Group in general and which focuses more specifically on key issues affecting the Company on a European scale.
The Company has formalized an Equality Plan with the Equality Plan Monitoring and Negotiation Commission, which the majority unions are a part of – and this plan falls under the scope of the Framework Agreement. The plan puts the focus on female talent, with measures in areas such as selection, training, professional promotion, remuneration, and professional classification. The last update of 2022 concludes that there is no discriminatory treatment at Repsol, nor are there inequalities based on sex. The plan was modified to respond to a new challenge: to advance the presence of women in the Company due to the fact that our sector continues to be mostly male, despite the progress made in recent years.
In addition, the plan includes a broad and improved set of reconciliation measures, a protocol for prevention and action against harassment, and a protocol for the protection of victims of violence in the family environment.
Since 2020, Repsol has held a Sustainability Roundtable with the Group's most representative unions in Spain, where issues such as sustainability plans, non-financial information

from management reports, circular economy initiatives, strategic S&E projects, etc. are discussed.
Employee health and wellbeing Repsol is committed to investing efforts and resources in health and well-being and, since 2018, it has approached this mission with a holistic approach and attention being paid to mental health as a key aspect for employee well-being in a context of transformation in terms of how work is done.
Repsol continues working on the review of health protocols issued by the authorities so as to adapt them to the current times in each country and any new health emergencies that may arise.
The Company has a strategic framework for occupational health and well-being implemented in all countries and which aims to share common guidelines and make resources available to employees to help them improve and maintain their health and well-being. During 2022, initiatives focused on physical, emotional, and cardiovascular wellbeing were developed, as well as on other health-related prevention and promotion campaigns.
Thus, the Company is prepared to face the challenges of the present and the future; it values its legacy and continues to transform and develop its professionals by providing them with the tools they need to enhance their talent and by taking care of each one of them through competitive working conditions, fair and inclusive treatment, and with concern for health, flexibility, training, and wellbeing.
6.4.3 Respect for human rights and community relations
Repsol considers the role of companies as agents of change to be key in terms of respecting human rights and, thus, this idea constitutes a very relevant managerial aspect in all of the company's business activities. The two cornerstones of respect for human rights are as follows: governance and commitment at the highest level, as well as excellent social performance on a day-to-day basis.

The Company’s aim is to always operate with the acceptance of internal and external stakeholders, maintaining solid
relationships therewith based on respect and honest, proactive, and transparent dialog that seeks shared benefit and contributes to local, socioeconomic, and environmental development.
Human rights due diligence is the management model used to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remedy negative impacts and to maximize the positive consequences of the Company's business activities. Therefore, there is a commitment from top management (which also extends to the people who work in the field) that brings them to carry out their work based on the most demanding international standards, and this commitment is accompanied by a process of dialog with all stakeholders. This commitment is present throughout the value chain, providing support to contractors and partners to achieve better performance in terms of handling social aspects.
Repsol’s commitment to human rights
Since its approval in 2008, the Human Rights and Community Relations Policy has been adapted to comply with the highest international standards. It represents the formal commitment of top management to steer the Company’s endeavors in this area.
This commitment spans the entire life cycle of the Company’s business activities, from the design, construction, and commissioning phases of the projects to their execution and decommissioning. Repsol also promotes compliance with the highest international standards among employees, contractors, suppliers, and partners.
To this end, the Company actively takes part in industry-wide initiatives, in partnership with other companies from the sector. For example, through IPIECA, an association in which Repsol collaborates in different working groups. These include Social Responsibility and SDG.

Human rights governance is established at the highest level and is supplemented by specialized teams that carry out the day-to-day management of human rights and the relationship with the surrounding communities. Repsol has a 19 local sustainability plans, which include information on Human Rights Expert Group since 2020 which coordinates the global strategy throughout the Company. One of the actions carried out in 2022 was the Human Rights Course being published on the Company website and open to all, with special attention focused on suppliers and contractors since the procurement and contracts function has already carried out this training in 2021.
In this regard, the Code of Ethics and Conduct for Suppliers has also been reviewed, including new social risks.12 In addition, work is being done to adapt to the future European Directive on Due Diligence on Human Rights, focusing especially on new renewable energy projects.

As part of the due diligence process, Repsol annually defines human rights objectives at global and local levels. These objectives are added to the Global Sustainability Plan and the
the progress.
Priority issues on human rights Repsol identifies and prioritizes human rights issues based on the severity and scope of the impacts of its activities and how easily they can be remediated. The Company therefore relies on several sources: analysis of risks and impacts, social audits, grievance mechanisms, consultations with stakeholders and the feedback received from the different countries with operations.

Due diligence management model
Repsol uses due diligence in human rights as the ideal model for managing internal processes with an anticipatory approach focused on the identification, evaluation, and mitigation of risks and impacts associated with the activity itself, as well as in the search for new opportunities. The due diligence model is applied throughout all stages of the life cycle of the assets, from the beginning to abandonment. Proactive and fluid dialog is at the heart of human rights due diligence and the process involves all stakeholders: contractors, partners, employees, communities, etc. and it is based on the main international standards.
The objective is to minimize the risks and any negative impacts and maximize the positive impacts. The following actions are therefore carried out in all projects and operations:
• Exhaustive analysis of the context and the specific social,

economic, and cultural characteristics of each area.

5 Performance of Sustainability Outlook Appendices our businesses
• Identification and assessment of risks, as well as
• Design and implementation of mitigation plans for risks
• Identification of social opportunities to maximize positive
These actions are combined with participation strategies with local communities and other stakeholders in all operating projects. All this contributes to the sustainable development of the communities in the area of influence of our operations and helps Repsol to obtain and maintain its social license to operate.
An example of an initiative involving local stakeholders is the Caipipendi Block (Bolivia), where nearby communities are informed of the scope of all projects being carried out in the block. In addition to describing the scope of the project, the benefits for the community are reported during these meetings and the number of local staff members and services to be contracted is agreed. Subsequently, the committed agreements are monitored and followed up on, evidence of our commitment to transparency at all times.
Activities are developed in accordance with the environmental, social, and health impact assessment standard in force since 2011, which ensures that an environmental, social, and health risk and impact assessment process is carried out for all Repsol projects and activities in order to identify and assess risks and impacts and, where applicable, deploy the necessary prevention and mitigation measures, all the while involving stakeholders. Before starting a new project, business units run a preliminary analysis of the social, environmental and health context, as well as of the legal requirements, identified potential impacts and the vulnerability of the local environment.
The social impact assessment takes into account, among other matters, the right to land and its natural resources, the right to a healthy environment, and the right to preserve the identity and culture of communities. In addition, the Company has had its own methodology for assessing human rights impacts since 2014.
All impact assessments conducted in 2022 (5 in total: 1 in Peru, 3 in Spain, and 1 in the USA) included social and human rights aspects.
Repsol includes human rights clauses in contracts with partners and suppliers, assesses their performance, and provides support through awareness-raising activities to ensure human rights due diligence along the entire value chain.
In operations in which Repsol does not participate in the management of social aspects, as is the case with non- operating assets, information is shared with partners on commitments, policies, and practices and the Company’s know-how, expertise, and techniques necessary to implement its objectives are made available thereto.

Grievance and remediation mechanisms
Repsol has grievance mechanisms for communities, employees, partners, suppliers, customers, and any third party. The Company is committed to verifying any report or complaint received and to cooperating to remediate the impact caused by its activities or those of its partners or contractors. This allows us to be proactive, respond to minor incidents before they escalate, and provide an early way of reparation for to affected parties.
These mechanisms include the Repsol Ethics and Compliance Channel, the Employee Service Desk, and the Customer Care Service. However, many of the concerns, worries, and complaints from stakeholders are related to impacts on the communities near operations, which is why it is essential to have operational-level grievance mechanisms as well.
These mechanisms are designed in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, in collaboration with partners and other stakeholders. They are adapted to the specific characteristics of the environment and are accessible to all so that they are considered legitimate by all concerned. This helps to create an environment of trust and respect that makes it easier for anyone to report complaints or grievances without fear of retaliation. Moreover, these mechanisms are no impediment to in-court or out-of-court proceedings, nor do they affect the legitimate and peaceful activities of human rights defenders.
Relevant complaints are handled at the local level and forwarded to the communities and human rights expert team of the Sustainability Division so that, if necessary, they may be submitted to the Executive Committee for review and possible management.
During 2022, a total of 107 grievances were received(96 in 2021), excluding those related to the incident that occurred in Terminal 2 of the La Pampilla refinery, which are treated separately due to that incident's magnitude (it came up as a result of an impact generated and not normal operations). The increase compared to 2021 is due to the inclusion of claims from the renewables business (47) for the first time. All claims have been addressed and 81% resolved.

Types of social grievances in 2022
As a result of the accident that occurred in Terminal 2 of the La Pampilla refinery (Peru) on January 15, 2022, a grievance mechanism adapted to the circumstances was designed and implemented, accessible to anyone through different communications channels, including the web page where the progress in the environmental and social remediation is being published. The image 'Social action plan for the incident at La Pampilla refinery terminal 2' shows additional information on the social action plan put in place to respond to the implemented social action plan in response to the incident. Claims could be filed through the website, by email, phone, WhatsApp, social media or in person.
Grievances received during 2022 related to this accident amounted to 3,932. All of them were addressed and resolved throughout the year. Additionally, community liaison officers took care of more than 7,400 queries from the population and more than 8,000 case files related to the compensation process, presented by the Parties' Reporting Desk, are being managed.

Indigenous communities Repsol recognizes and respects the unique nature of these communities and their rights to the land and natural resources. Actions in environments with indigenous communities are governed by Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), regardless of whether or not it has been transposed into the national legislation of each country.
In accordance with this commitment and the requirements included in Repsol’s regulatory framework, feasible alternative designs that minimize land acquisition and restrictions on land and subsoil use are considered prior to starting each activity to avoid resettlement and adverse impacts on local communities and those using the land.
Another key aspect of managing indigenous communities is respect for their right to free, prior, and informed consultation. Repsol verifies the level of acceptance of the indigenous peoples in all its activities and actively seeks the consent of those potentially affected. Otherwise, both the potential impacts and the advisability of continuing with the project are assessed, a decision that is taken by the Executive Committee.

Economic impact on communities and shared value The Company, in line with its commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, contributes to social development by maximizing the positive impacts generated by its activities and enhancing shared value in its projects. The social investment strategy focuses on an exhaustive analysis of the needs of the context, and on the priority SDGs for Repsol (6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, and 17).
The social investment management standard, aimed at guaranteeing transparency and optimizing positive impacts, governs these processes: Repsol assesses opportunities that bring about positive impacts in each context and enhance the shared value when undertaking projects, while at the same time avoiding future dependencies. Sustainable socio- economic development stemming from planning based on dialog and consensus with local communities is a key priority and determines the scope of the investment.
In 2022, social investment amounted to 49 million euros (33 million euros in 2021).13
Security and human rights Repsol has been adhered to the United Nations Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights since 2013 to guarantee the security of operations in sensitive or conflict zones through working procedures that ensure respect for human rights.
Repsol asks private security companies to guarantee that 100% of the employees providing services at its facilities are trained in human rights. The Company oversees this training or undertakes courses for corporate security personnel. In addition, in some countries, public security and law enforcement agencies receive specific training in human rights.

6.5. Safe operations1
Repsol is committed to carrying out its activities considering the health and safety of its people and environmental protection as essential values, based on the firm conviction that all accidents are preventable and avoidable. This continuous effort in recent years has led to a significant improvement in safety, although we are certain that we can continue to improve, as serious accidents are still occurring. Therefore, the Company considers it essential to focus on the interactions between people, the safety culture, facilities, processes, and work systems.
This drive to improve safety is reinforced with the 2022 update of the Health and Safety Policy, which includes commitments in terms of the human factor, fair recognition, and error management as a source of organizational learning. Said policy includes the commitments that allow our activities to be carried out while preserving the integrity of our people and avoiding any damage to the environment, all the while ensuring a healthy and safe work environment from both a physical and mental point of view:

As a general rule, environment and safety information includes 100% of the data from companies in which Repsol holds a controlling interest or control over operations. In particular, in the field of security, this includes data from contractors that provide services under a direct contract.

In addition, in 2022 the Safety and Environment Excellence Program has been launched, the aim of which is to take a qualitative leap while promoting the culture of safety and the environment protection. The program was born with a clear operational focus, led by new corporate management in coordination with those responsible for all the Company's businesses. Currently, has already advanced in the first diagnostic phase, with the entire organization involved in said phase, including partners and collaborators. This will make it possible to identify strengths and weaknesses in order to later move on to the implementation and monitoring phases.
As a basis for the diagnosis, the safety management system updated and formalized during 2022 is being used. In accordance with international and industry standards and best practices, the system establishes the safety requirements applicable to operations throughout the entire life cycle and it facilitates uniform risk management in all areas throughout Repsol. It is made up of the following key attributes:
• Two fundamentals, which constitute the bases of the

and a series of requirements:

The safety culture is one of the fundamentals of the management system, without which its effective and full implementation is not possible. Thus, in order to achieve and maintain excellent safety performance, it is necessary to ensure that the attributes of Repsol's safety culture model are reflected in the elements of the management system.
The second fundamental, continuous improvement, is key to preventing accidents, especially the most serious ones. To spark continuous questioning, promote learning, and avoid possible complacency inside the organization, it is essential to have specific improvement processes. Thus, Repsol continues to work on deploying specific safety culture diagnostics across its assets and businesses. In 2022, the LPG business and the Spanish Upstream unit's diagnostics were completed, contemplating the dismantling of the Casablanca and Poseidón assets, something which brings the sum to more than 25 since the start in 2015.
Fair recognition is one of the attributes of Repsol's safety culture model and a key element in achieving a climate of trust in which safety information flows, latent system risks are identified and corrected, and organizational learning is promoted.
During 2022, the bases were established and the conceptual framework was defined which has allowed for the development of a pilot project in the LPG business, incorporating the lessons learned into a second pilot in the Upstream business. Both will make it possible to continue laying the foundations for deployment in the rest of the businesses in the coming years -- something which is in line with the provisions of the Health and Safety Policy.
As an example of concrete actions from these pilots, work is being done to eliminate the differences between "imagined work" and "performed work" for key processes, both in terms of safety and operations. This is making it possible to identify • Artificial intelligence, for process optimization, risk actions for improvement at all levels of the organization at both a technical and a human level.

In safety leadership training, the Safety Leap program has been tailored and delivered to the technical groups that are part of the Industrial business and the Upstream business units based in North America (Eagle Ford, Marcellus, and Canada).
Repsol is convinced that collaboration between different companies and industry associations is key to improving safety and accelerating the learning process. Repsol continuously participates and collaborates in organizations such as:
• International Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP), promoting a
• Energy Institute, sponsoring the JIP Toolbox as a tool to
• International Process Safety Group (IPSG), acting as hosts
• Center for Chemical Process Safety (CCPS), hosting the
All these collaborations have also been reflected internally with the preparation of the internal guide entitled "Improving Human Performance in Safety: Understanding before Acting," which analyzes the interactions of the organization, the work environment, and the people and provides tools applicable to asset managers.
6.5.1 Personal safety
The Company is working to reduce personal accidents, especially those with the most serious potential consequences, doing so in conjunction with the groups that are most involved: employees, contractors, and suppliers.
In 2022, the incident management standard was revised and concepts such as "remote work" and "on mission work" were included. Likewise, the requirements for the management of high potential indicators (HPI) were clarified and simplified and the reporting area was reviewed and aligned in accordance with good industry practices.
Transport continues to be one of the main causes of harm to people, both personally and professionally. For this reason, the Safe Mobility course has been re-done, also being updated online with all the new means of transport.
Repsol is constantly developing tools that allow for the digitization of security:

In 2022, it is worth noting the launch of a proof of concept from the Knowledge Graph Accident Taxonomy, IA (KATIA) project, whose objective is to improve safety through the analysis of spill data.
At Repsol, occupational accident indicators are reported in accordance with the incident management standard, based on international standards (IOGP and OSHA), which establishes the common criteria and methodology to properly record and manage incidents, improvement actions and lessons learned. Accordingly, incidents are classified depending on the severity of their actual and potential consequences.
All employees are required to report any incident they experience or witness. The incident is recorded in the IT tool and an investigation process is then opened to identify the root causes and to propose improvement actions and lessons learned. The standard affects 100% of the companies in which Repsol has a majority interest or control over operation. Incidents affecting contractors that provide their services under a direct contract are also recorded.
Unfortunately, in 2022 we had to regret the death of three subcontracted workers in occupational accidents. In March at the A Coruña refinery: during the opening of a line cover. When two workers were carrying out this task, they were affected by the inhalation of gases. One of them died days later in the hospital. The investigation committee was made up of specialist technicians from the different areas of the refinery, as well as workers' representatives. In October, also at the A Coruña refinery, a worker from an auxiliary company died while carrying out specialist tasks in a construction project. The accident was caused by the impact of an element of the tool used during concrete injection.
In addition, in October, a tanker truck (tractor and trailer unit) overturned, and a second vehicle was also involved. The driver of the overturned tanker died in the accident. Although the event is still under investigation by the competent authority, it has been confirmed that the vehicle complied with applicable safety measures and legal inspections, and that the environmental and road conditions posed no difficulties.

Repsol considers process safety to begin in the design phase of the installation and to continue throughout the entire life cycle of the asset and until the dismantling and abandonment of the installations. To this end, the Company works on the design, implementation, management, and maintenance of safety barriers and critical processes that guarantee the integrity of the facilities through operational discipline and compliance with our global standards and operating procedures, based on international standards such as API, NFPA, ISO, EN, IEC, IOGP, and CCPS.
Repsol runs inspection and preventive maintenance programs to check the correct functioning of safety- critical systems and equipment. These programs are part of the Company’s tools that help improve and prevent leaks of dangerous products.

In 2022, the number of safety incidents from Tier 1 and Tier 2 processes increased with respect to 2021 by 5 accidents, although these indicators are in asymptotic values, and are better than the target values established in the continuous improvement path. These incidents mainly took place in Upstream, due to a significant increase in activity and to the integrity of the facilities. Actions are being carried out to improve integrity, inspection plans, and monitoring programs.

In 2022, two relevant spills occurred in Peru. The first occurred on January 15 at Terminal 2 of the La Pampilla Refinery while crude oil was being unloaded from the ship Mare Doricum. The amount spilled was 1,460 tons (see infographic on the next page entitled "Environmental actions against the spill in Terminal 2 of the La Pampilla Refinery," and Section 5.2.1, "Refining"). The second spill occurred as a result of a tanker overturning while trying to avoid two mounds of minerals on a sloping curve and under rainy weather conditions. The driver was unharmed, but one of the hatches opened, spilling 32 tons of the product it was carrying. The remediation work was carried out through a specialized external company.
The Company has internal and external emergency response mechanisms and has specialized and trained teams that use the most advanced detection tools and follow specific management and training protocols to ensure the allocation of the highest priority required in each case. Once the situation has been controlled, new preventive actions are established to prevent the same thing from happening again. These mechanisms are critical components for Repsol, and are fundamental in reducing the impact on individuals and the environment.
In the event of maritime spills, in addition to our own response means, Repsol has contracts in place that guarantee rapid action by external specialists and equipment (Oil Spills Response Limited - OSRL, including access to the Global Dispersants Stockpile, Wild Well Control, Helix, etc.).

6.5.4 Emergency preparedness and crisis management
Repsol does its utmost to prevent accidents, which is done with careful preparation for any possible contingency. Therefore, in addition to prevention, it works on mechanisms frequent training, drills, and exercises at all levels -- including that enable early detection of any situation and the rapid and effective management of safety, environmental or other emergencies.
The Company continues to make progress and improve its comprehensive crisis and emergency management model. In addition to traditional oil and gas sector and in-house expertise, it includes industry best practices and is applied to crisis and emergency management at the business or corporate levels. It involves senior management in the most serious cases and ensures the allocation of specific resources, such as management support teams specifically trained and coached each year, with 24/7 coverage.

The crisis and emergency management standard ensures a minimum and uniform management standard, as well as
at least one annual exercise at the highest level of the Company.
In 2022, the annual drill to learn how to act in the event of crises and emergencies was developed around a hypothetical scenario of a cyberattack on the Company's main systems, preventing normal operations. Senior management participated in this drill and it was led by the CEO. In addition to training the teams on how the crisis plan should be carried out and executed, the aim was to verify that the technical resources and the complex coordination mechanisms between the various management groups would function when activated at the same time (Crisis Management Team, Business Support Team and CMT Support Group).

commitment to transparency
Repsol explains its tax contribution and discloses relevant information so that it can be appraised by interested parties. The main reports available on the company's website (www.repsol.com) are the following:
1. Tax Contribution Report. It discloses all taxes and other public levies paid, broken down by item and country.
2. Country-by-country report for corporate income tax. Report as presented to the tax authorities and which Repsol publishes on a voluntary basis, containing further disclosures relating to the corporate income tax paid in each country in which we operate.
3. Report on Repsol’s presence in tax havens. It describes and explain the activities carried out and the taxes paid in these jurisdictions.
This commitment to transparency has earned us numerous recognitions.1
Good tax practices
The Group’s tax decisions are made responsibly in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of tax regulations, following not only the letter but also the spirit of the law. In the event of any disagreement or dispute with the tax authorities, Repsol prioritizes amicable solutions, though if the disagreement persists, the company defends its legitimate rights and interests through the legally available channels and appeal mechanisms.
Repsol is committed to complying with best practices of responsible taxation and tax governance through voluntary adherence to internationally accepted principles, guidelines and recommendations (Code of Good tax Practices, GRI 207, Repsol releases detailed information on its presence and OECD, B-Team). For more information, see Appendix V and www.repsol.com include detailed information on Repsol’s compliance with these transparency standards and, more precisely, with GRI 207.

Cooperative relations with tax authorities
Repsol is committed to maintaining cooperative relations with the tax administrations of the various countries in which it operates, based on the principles of good faith, transparency and mutual trust, and with the shared goal of ensuring the effective application of the tax system. Following this approach, Repsol expects to reduce the inherent risks and uncertainties applying tax rules, facilitate the tax authorities to understand its operations and avoid unnecessary conflicts.
Notably, Repsol has submitted, as has been doing since 2015, its Voluntary Tax Transparency Report before the Spanish Tax Office (AEAT). It also continues to lend its support to international cooperation initiatives for the prevention of tax risks and, after having taken part in the first program of the OECD International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP), it is now participating in the European Trust and Cooperation Approach (ETACA) of the European Union and in the CONFIA program in Brazil.
Presence in non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes
Repsol is committed to having no presence in tax havens, unless it is for legitimate business reasons, in which case it undertakes to be transparent in its activities.
Repsol’s presence in these non-cooperating jurisdictions is immaterial and any presence it does have is not intended to conceal its business activities or make them less transparent. The revenue obtained there does not account for even 0.01% of our turnover and there is only one active Group company that has presence, through a permanent establishment, in one of these territories (Trinidad and Tobago), carrying out hydrocarbon upstream activities.
activities not only in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions but also in other territories considered controversial for tax purposes by civil organizations, even though they may not be included on official lists2.

6.7. Supply chain and customers
6.7.1. Supply chain
Sustainable supply chain management Repsol responds to the expectations of stakeholders and compliance with ethical, labor, environmental, safety and social standards through the sustainability of its supply chain. Likewise, it promotes employment and the rights of employees among local communities and drives local economic and social development where it operates. In this regard, it is aligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and contributes to the 17 SDGs, seeking to integrate commitment, dissemination and action in favor of this global agenda into its culture.
In this regard, the space available on the Repsol website, called ‘Sustainable Management along the Supply Chain’,features relevant content related to sustainability and the commitment to the United Nations 2030 Agenda. This space seeks to disseminate the culture and actions carried out to support this global agenda and in this regard the Repsol Sustainable Development Goals Contribution Plan has been made available to all suppliers. Another tool developed to raise awareness on this matter is a dissemination course for employees and suppliers, called ODStories. This course works like a fictitious social network and navigates through the different SDGs, showing examples of how Repsol contributes to them.
This sustainable supply chain management requires greater transparency in the information disclosed to both local communities and consumers, while at the same time promoting good practices among suppliers and contractors. The relationship with suppliers and their respect for human rights are fundamental pillars to achieve a just transition to which Repsol is committed. Moreover, the goal of managing risks and being diligent with the impacts derived from commercial relations with its partners, suppliers and contractors2 was also set.
Suppliers play an important role in Repsol’s value chain. That is why they must comply with current regulations and adopt the Group’s good practices. For their part, contractors must adopt behaviors in line with the Suppliers Code of Ethics and Conduct, aimed at mutual benefit, by including obligations such as the rejection of child labor, the rejection of forced labor, freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, in addition to ethical behavior and measures against bribery, corruption and conflict of interest.
Integrated Management Report 2022
1 2022 Overview
1 Information related to the Repsol Group's purchases, managed by the purchasing function in accordance with the Company's internal regulatory framework, is included 2 By law, the illegal assignment of workers is not allowed. For this reason, Repsol’s internal purchasing and procurement regulations establish that services are contracted with suppliers and not with people. This condition prevents specific data on employees who are not workers from being provided.

Likewise, they must act in accordance with the code, as well as with the Anti-corruption Policy.
Repsol ensures the absolute integrity of its commitments to suppliers, which are based on mutual respect and trust. With this aim, control levels and a procedure to ensure that they behave in accordance with the Company’s commitments in this regard were implemented. This allows for continuity of operations and mitigates the risks of the process.
Risk management Repsol is aware that the supply chain poses specific risks and can help create jobs and promote local economies where it operates. Thus, it works to ensure that suppliers and contractors behave in accordance with the commitments they have undertaken. In this regard, the company is adapting selection, qualification and monitoring processes to identify and mitigate risks at different stages of the business relationship. Suppliers who want to work with Repsol must undergo a due diligence process relating to risk management, integrity, and international sanctions and embargoes, among others.
The Company inserts specific clauses in its contracts insisting that the counterparty complies with internationally recognized standards and observes the safety, environmental, ethical behavior and respect for human rights provisions of its internal rules and regulations.

Likewise, awareness-raising activities are carried out among the counterparties and there is a standard of due diligence with third parties, applicable to business relations to manage the risks related to corruption, money laundering and terrorist financing, and international sanctions and embargoes.
Environmental and social assessment of suppliers Repsol works together with its value chain to implement initiatives related to the environment, SDGs and circular economy. In this sense, it defines the principles of action on the environment in the phase of carrying out new contracts and agreements with partners and third parties. As for the acquisition of goods and services with a high safety and environmental risk, the inclusion of environmental criteria in supplier performance qualification and assessment, contractual clauses and bid evaluation is monitored.

Repsol has set itself the goal of developing and implementing agile and effective mechanisms whereby it can verify compliance with the agreed conditions and implement corrective measures if deemed necessary, so that the performance of the participants in the supply chain is the one that corresponds.
The procedure established to ensure efficient risk management in the supply chain is illustrated below.
Thus, in the due diligence phase, suppliers are registered in the purchasing management systems, undergoing prior filtering using the Refinitiv World Check One tool. This tool is used to assess aspects of integrity, anti-corruption, bribery and international sanctions and embargoes to mitigate risks. This information is regularly reviewed and updated for all suppliers that maintain a relationship with Repsol.

Likewise, the Company has internal and external audit procedures that examine and monitor to ensure that the established requirements are met. Moreover, and depending on the purpose of the award, it is necessary to fill out several compliance questionnaires on the security of operations and compliance with additional legal requirements (data protection, illegal assignment of workers, cybersecurity, etc.).
Thus, in 2022, integrity, corruption and bribery aspects were assessed at 9,338 suppliers worldwide (4,015 in 2021). These assessments revealed material information on 20 companies (21 on 2021) relating to international sanctions, judicial investigations for fraud and/or bribery, fines for anti- competitive activities or environmental damage, and relationships with politically exposed persons. In accordance with Repsol’s internal regulations, the responsible areas undertook due diligence actions by applying the specific analyses included in the internal regulations, in order to mitigate any compliance risks that might arise. To this end, several instructive actions have been carried out for employees in the purchasing area and for some suppliers in certain regions.
Furthermore, in 2022, in the tender processes, suppliers are assessed on the basis of a safety and environmental technical benchmark, with relevant issues and aspects for the new contract and relationship. The aim is to maintain the social license to operate, demonstrating that Repsol is sustainable throughout its entire value chain.
Thus, in 2022, 5 assessment audits were conducted on suppliers, in which financial and business aspects, among others, related to their fiscal, tax and insurance obligations were analyzed. As a result, it was determined that none of the audited companies present any relevant non- conformities, meaning they are therefore considered serious and reliable to establish a satisfactory business relationship.
In addition, a total of 3,702 performance assessments were completed in 2022 at 878 suppliers and contractors, taking into consideration environmental, labor, social and integrity aspects.
From this procedure, there is a supplier disqualification process, through which any current and future business relationship with a certain supplier is blocked for a period of time or even indefinitely. It takes into account all kinds of aspects in the relationship with the supplier (ethical, social, safety, environment, etc.) and is approved by the Purchasing Functional Committee. In 2022, 2 suppliers were disqualified by these means.

Indirect economic impact Repsol indirectly contributes to the generation of wealth in the local economy by supporting local companies, encouraging them to join its network of suppliers and contractors. Moreover, local purchasing has the advantage of geographical proximity between the point of origin and the point of demand, which provides a faster response to emerging needs and greater flexibility in operations.
In the same way, Repsol generates indirect employment opportunities in the projects it carries out in different countries. The percentage of purchases and procurement that were made locally in 2022 represents 83% of the total purchases in the year. These purchases focused on medical services, logistics (civil engineering, catering, accommodation, vehicle rental and driver rental), warehouse and office lease, and IT support, waste management and courier services.
Furthermore, the Company aims to develop cross-company circular economy initiatives in partnership with external firms and working with all Group businesses to add secondary raw materials to its value chain, maximize process efficiency, reduce waste, create new products and services and driven eco-design.
Average payment period to suppliers
The average period for payment3 to suppliers of Spanish companies in 2022 was 38 days, below the maximum statutory period of 60 days set out in Law 15/2010, of 5 July (amended by the final provision two of Law 31/2014), on measures to combat late payment in commercial transactions.

6.7.2. Responsible management of customers
Safety across the product life cycle
Managing the safety of the products sold is a priority for the Company and is present through all stages of their life cycle. In addition to the applicable legislation in force, Repsol has internal regulations that establish the requirements to ensure appropriate management of risks from the very beginning of the research to design a product until it is sold on the market.
During the design phase, any hazards are identified and potential risks arising from use are assessed in order to take the appropriate measures to manage these risks. As an example, in the project for new circular polyols manufactured from polyurethane waste, knowledge has been generated about the possible adverse effects on people and the environment by carrying out several laboratory studies. This knowledge was applied to assess the potential risks associated with manufacturing at the centers and subsequent use by customers. This information is being communicated to workers and customers through the safety data sheet, which includes the conclusions from the results of the studies and the measures for safely handling the product.
Ensuring product safety involves ongoing monitoring to detect new or changing risks. Therefore, products already made available to customers are also re-assessed in order to ensure efficient updates.
Repsol encourages participation in voluntary programs of the processing of the different types of personal data. sector itself and European bodies that examine in greater detail specific knowledge about certain products. For example, together with European companies that manufacture diesel processed with hydrocarbons from renewable sources (vegetable oil or animal fats), the Company is participating in several studies aimed at obtaining further knowledge about their possible adverse effects.
The Company is also part of a project focused on improving scientific knowledge of NLP (no longer polymers) polyols. This project, led by the top manufacturers of this type of product, seeks to improve toxicological knowledge of the same based on a limited number of studies, and subsequent extrapolation of results between different polyols within the same group or category.
Technological innovation also makes it possible to increase safety, optimize the use of raw materials, eliminate emissions and contribute to reducing the waste generated.

Communication of hazards
In compliance with internal regulations, Repsol provides information on the hazards of each product it sells through safety data sheets and hazard labels so that customers can take the appropriate measures to handle them safely.
It works with a global tool that allows access to all product safety documents from a single repository available to all employees. This tool also allows an advanced analysis to be carried out, by company or by product range, of the different parameters of the products handled for the entire company. These documents are available to Repsol customers and employees in accordance with the laws of the country where the product is to be handled. Business and product data come together in the tool, which allows Repsol to automatically send safety documents to customers.
Customer privacy4 Privacy and personal data protection is one of the most relevant issues for companies today, due to the volume of information handled, which includes personal and financial data of customers, suppliers and employees.
Repsol ensures the fundamental right to the protection of personal data of all individuals that have a relationship with the Group companies. The Company therefore carries out all its activities in accordance with the laws of the countries in which it operates, in keeping with its spirit and purpose, and ensuring respect for the right to honor and privacy in the
The Data Protection Division, which is part of the Compliance Processes Department, is tasked with advising on and managing the personal data protection compliance model. This division is composed of a team of professionals specializing in privacy that offer advisory services to the entire Company through a corporate mailbox. In 2020, the OneTrust software suite was acquired as an ideal platform for ensuring compliance with data privacy regulations across all sectors and jurisdictions, including the EU GDPR and Privacy Shield. Throughout 2021, a loading of the records of processing activities and risk analysis was carried out. In 2022, a method for monitoring recommendations from the Data Protection area was implemented through the corporate tool SACI, an Onetrust optimization process was carried out and the security breach module of this tool was started to be used.

The configuration of the module and the fact of having a tool that serves as a register to record any analysis of incidents that affect data independently of their criticality has led to a substantial increase in the number of incidents reported, since it has made it possible to strengthen the model and not only count incidents not only of medium or high risk but also of low or negligible risk.

Code of Ethics and Conduct2
Repsol’s Code of Ethics and Conduct is approved by the Board of Directors and applies to all directors, executives, and employees, whatever the nature of their contractual relationship with Repsol. Our business partners, including non-operated joint ventures, contractors, suppliers and other third parties, are an extension of Repsol, and for this reason they should act consistently with our code, as well as any applicable contractual provisions, when working on our behalf or in collaboration with us. These business partners are also encouraged to develop and implement ethics programs that are consistent with our standards. This Code creates a frame of reference for understanding and putting into practice the Company’s expectations as to each person’s behavior, in light of the Group’s principles of action.

In 2022, Repsol once again has undertaken a global initiative for training on and dissemination of its Code of Ethics and Conduct. This includes all employees (even part-time employees –something new this year) and aims to continue promoting a positive culture of compliance, as well as to measure the knowledge that employees have on certain issues to this end. Specifically, the dissemination campaign entitled “Los intachables” ("The Flawless") has been developed with a total of seven dissemination initiatives by senior management that included sketches, interviews, podcasts, and ethics regulations. Likewise, mandatory training has been deployed for all employees (entitled "Tu conducta en juego" – "Your conduct at stake") in an interactive, innovative, and disruptive format. Additionally, it is worth noting the expansion of our voluntary network of compliance ambassadors to more than 100 people and our holding of three compliance days: one worldwide (with recognition of the best practices in this area) and two local ones (in Mexico and Houston, USA).
The aim, among others, of the Ethics and Compliance Committee is to manage the monitoring and compliance system for the Code of Ethics and Conduct. In accordance with the committee’s own internal regulations, it is a collective, high-level, multidisciplinary body, with autonomous powers of initiative and control, and other powers necessary to carry out its functions. It comprises representatives from Legal Affairs, People and Organization (Corporate), Audit, Control and Risk, Legal Services (Corporate) and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and Labor Relations, Labor Legal Affairs and Occupational Health.

The Ethics and Compliance Channel3 is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It is managed by an external service provider, which allows employees and any third party to communicate directly with the committee with absolute confidentiality and anonymity, and in any language. Said individuals can raise queries or report possible breaches of the Code of Ethics and Conduct and the Crime Prevention Model.
In 2022, 91 pieces of correspondence were received through the Ethics and Compliance Channel, of which 55 resulted in an investigation. At the end of the year, 6 cases of discrimination and harassment were confirmed, although most of them correspond to situations involving a lack of respect and unwanted or annoying behavior, of minor importance. No cases of corruption, or violation of human rights were proven.
The Company has the internal investigation procedure of the Ethics and Compliance Committee, as well as an orientation guide for investigators and channel managers regarding personal data protection and other regulations. The regulation emphasize that no type of retaliation is allowed against a person who in good faith discloses or alerts a breach or raises questions about the code, internal regulations, and/or the law. Nor are retaliations allowed against anyone who collaborates in an investigation. Specifically, everything mentioned above is guaranteed and regulated first and foremost by the principles of impartiality, confidentiality, professionalism, and independence.

Fight against corruption and bribery
Repsol reiterates its commitment to strict compliance with regulations for the prevention and fight against corruption4 and fraud in all their forms, developing the principles contained in the Code of Ethics and Conduct and extending compliance therewith not only to all employees of the companies in which we exercise direct or indirect managerial control, but also to our business partners.
During the general recurring process of reviewing and updating internal regulations, in 2022 the Company reviewed its Anti-Corruption Policy, changing its name to the Integrity Policy as its contents were expanded to include aspects related not only to corruption but also to fraud (following the lines of European regulations). Said regulations include Repsol's express position regarding illegal conducts like

corruption, fraud, and conflicts of interest in an additional, more detailed way than what is listed in the Code of Ethics and Conduct, covering not only illegal conduct but also aspects that are unethical or dishonest.
The Ethics and Compliance Committee is also Repsol’s crime prevention unit for the purposes of Article 31 bis (2)(2) of the Spanish Criminal Code. Repsol has internal framework (Crime Prevention Model and Internal Investigations by the Ethics and Compliance Committee) that dictates the preventative measures and response mechanisms for breaches of the Code of Ethics and Conduct or suspected or confirmed criminal offenses within the scope of the Repsol Crime Prevention Model5.
In this context, the Ethics and Compliance Committee approves and monitors the annual plan for the updating and continuous improvement of the Crime Prevention Model. In terms of said Model, the following objectives and work carried out should be highlighted:

These rules are specifically focused on mitigating potential risks in terms of corruption and fraud. Repsol also has a Criminal Prevention Manual to improve the company's understanding of criminal risks and the actions and behaviors expected of employees. In addition, we have a comprehensive training plan that includes, among other things, simultaneous actions on the role of leaders, managers, executives, and the Repsol representative. Finally, an online course is available for those responsible for

Likewise, the Company has a guide to the anti-corruption compliance domain management system which describes the general standards and requirements, as well as controls and associated risks (bribery of officials, bribery in the private sector [offering and accepting bribes], and influence peddling). In 2022, 11 specific assessments were carried out in relation to corruption risks6.
Protection of fair competition
Repsol is firmly committed to complying with anti- trust regulations in all its spheres of action and in all countries in which it operates. This commitment is a core element of Repsol’s Code of Ethics and Conduct.
The Company believes in fair and effective competition on the market and we do not engage in inappropriate practices that might impair free competition. Nor does it seek to obtain competitive advantage through the use of unethical or
In addition, specific risk assessments continue to be carried out in terms of competition, and the measures implemented to prevent or mitigate risks are improved or reinforced as needed. Likewise, the Company has developed specific training and awareness initiatives, among which we can highlight the development of guidance and training materials, the development of micro-learning sessions on fair competition, and complementary training actions for the most sensitive groups. In 2022, an 80% attendance rate for synchronous training was reached and a total of 648 employees received training on compliance with competition regulations.
Repsol has an Anti-Trust Compliance Manual, a guide on how to act in the event of home inspections, guidelines on risks associated with participation in business associations, and a procedure for state aid, among other materials. The main aim is to continue to drive the implementation of these regulations, help all employees understand the fundamental principles governing anti-trust regulations, and provide them with clear guidelines to identify potential risk situations for the Company.
Additionally, the Ethics and Compliance Channel is available, among other resources, through which any employee or third party can direct any type of query or alert regarding compliance with anti-trust law.

7. Outlook
7.1 Outlook for the energy sector
Macroeconomic outlook
In early 2022, a slowdown in growth was expected as the relatively easy gains made following the re-opening of the economy in the wake of COVID-19 gradually faded, and also due to a reversal of sorts of the exceptional monetary and fiscal policy support that had been provided in 2020 and 2021. That said, growth was still expected to be very strong and relatively high by historical standards. However, the global economic outlook then suffered a serious setback, largely due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
On balance, the IMF’s January 2023 baseline scenario expects global GDP growth of 3.4% in 2022 and 2.9% in 2023. While the outlook was downgraded throughout 2022, an upgrade is now expected for 2022 and 2023, of 0.2 percentage points (pp) from the October forecast.
Notably, the negative repercussions have varied greatly between regions and countries. Europe has been more heavily affected by the war, given its greater reliance on energy imports. Thus, the Eurozone’s growth forecast for 2023 has been trimmed to just 0.7%, although this is an improvement of 0.2 percentage points on the previous forecast, in response to the surprising resilience shown by Europe in the third quarter and the relatively ease in adapting to the new environment.

Against this backdrop, forecasts and projections will be fraught with uncertainty. And the risks to these growth forecasts are skewed to the downside.
Firstly, the emergence of Omicron is a timely reminder that the pandemic is not over and that new virus variants may emerge, carrying additional risks and possibly derailing the recovery process, either because they are highly infectious or otherwise able to evade the protection given by vaccines.

Secondly, supply problems, coupled with the release of pent- up demand and the rebound in commodity prices, have caused a rapid rise in inflation, which could be more permanent than initially expected. Monetary tightening is more evident in the US, while in Europe the ECB will have to strike a delicate balance between addressing inflation, supporting activity and avoiding the risks of financial fragmentation. A sudden reassessment of the monetary policy outlook could tighten financial conditions and slow the recovery.
Energy sector outlook
Global supply/demand balance in 2023
Source: International Energy Agency (IEA) and Repsol Research Department.
According to November estimates of the International Energy Agency (IEA), global demand should rise 1.6 Mbbl/d in 2023 to reach average demand in 2023 of 101.4 Mbbl/d. Consumption among non-OECD countries would grow by 1.3 Mbbl/d, with China increasing its oil use by 0.8 mb/d. In contrast, demand in OECD countries would rise by only 0.3 Mbbl/d. On the supply side, the IEA expects the sanctions on Russia to cause its oil production to fall by 1.4 Mbbl/d in 2023.

This, together with the cut announced by the OPEC+ cartel, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia as de facto leaders, could generate tensions within the markets. However, the IEA estimates the actual cut within the cartel to be 0.8 Mbbl/d, as some of the producing countries in the group were already encountering serious difficulties in reaching the production quota set by themselves. On the non-OPEC+ supply side, production increases in 2023 would come mainly from the US (1 Mbbl/d), Brazil (0.3 Mbbl/d) and Norway (0.27 Mbbl/d). In any case, the oil markets are having to contend to high uncertainty and volatility, due to geopolitical issues such as the release of strategic oil reserves in the US, the signing of the nuclear agreement with Iran, which could return around 1 Mbbl/d to the market, or the easing of sanctions in Venezuela.
As for the Henry Hub natural gas market, the EIA expects natural gas prices to rise from late 2022 levels as a result of higher winter natural gas demand and increased LNG exports. The spot price is expected to exceed $6/MMBtu in 1Q23, and prices will likely begin to decline thereafter once the winter is over and as gas storage levels in the US approach the average for the past five years, largely in response to increased domestic gas production. Price volatility is expected to continue throughout 2023.
Meanwhile, production is expected to increase in 2023, despite persistent limitations in the Permian Basin due to a lack of pipeline capacity, as has been the case in previous years. On the demand side, a year-on-year contraction is expected in response to lower consumption in the generation and industrial sectors.
LNG trading will remain high once activity resumes at Freeport LNG, which is expected to reach full operating capacity by March 2023.
Long-term energy sector outlook
The world is in the midst of its first global energy crisis, a shock of unprecedented scale and complexity. The market pressures actually precede Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although Russia’s actions have turned what was promising a speedy economic recovery from the pandemic (albeit stretching all manner of global supply chains, including energy, to near breaking point) into a full-blown energy crisis. Russia has been by far the world’s largest exporter of fossil fuels, though its restrictions on natural gas supplies into Europe, coupled with European sanctions on Russian oil and coal imports, are cutting off one of the main arteries of global energy trade. While all fuels have been affected, the gas markets have been the epicenter, as Russia seeks leverage by exposing consumers to higher energy bills and supply shortages.
According to scenarios published in WEO 2022 by the IEA, under the STEPS baseline scenario, use of coal will decline over the coming years, demand for natural gas will plateau by the end of the decade, and rising electric vehicle (EV) sales mean that oil demand stabilizes in the mid-2030s before declining slightly through to 2050. Total fossil fuel demand will decline steadily from the mid-2020s by about 2 exajoules per year on average through 2050; an annual

5 Performance of Sustainability Outlook Appendices our businesses
reduction roughly equivalent to the lifetime production of a large oil field.
The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix has remained stubbornly high, at around 80%, for decades. By 2030 under the STEPS, this proportion falls below 75%, and to just over 60% by 2050. A high point for global energy- related CO2 emissions is reached in STEPS in 2025, at 37 billion metric tons (Gt) per year, before falling back to 32 Gt by 2050. This would be associated with an increase of about 2.5°C in global average temperatures by 2100. This is a better outcome than projected a few years ago: the renewed policy momentum and technological advances achieved since 2015 have been successful in reducing the long-term temperature increase by about 1°C. However, a reduction of only 13% in annual CO2 emissions by 2050 under STEPS is far from being enough to avoid the severe impacts of a changing climate.

7.2 Outlook for our businesses In 2023, the Group will continue to focus on pursuing its Strategic Plan and, therefore, on growth and on accelerating the transformation. The 21–25 Strategic Plan, the roadmap for the Company’s transformation, envisioned an initial period of resilience, during 2021 and 2022, which is now behind us, and a second period, 2023 to 2025, in which the main growth projects would take shape.
The Group continues to pursue its ambition of being a leader in the energy transition and in meeting the goals of growth, diversification and focus on multi-energy, while ensuring strong profitability and maximizing shareholder value. All of this would be achieved by developing a prudent financial policy and continuing to exercise caution in a still volatile environment.
The Renewables business remains very much a central pillar in the energy transition, with the goal of reaching 6 GW of renewable electricity generation capacity in operation by 2025. To succeed, in 2023 Repsol will continue to launch development projects in Spain, Chile and the United States, while also making progress on new projects in its portfolio, including those to have resulted from the acquisition of Asterion Energies (mainly located in Spain and Italy), and pressing on with its international expansion.
In 2023, the Industrial businesses will continue to drive transformation and the circular economy by bringing renewable hydrogen generation projects to fruition, such as the start-up of the first electrolyzer in Bilbao and the production of advanced biofuels at Cartagena, along with other initiatives in biogas, efuels, circular economy and waste recovery. All this while continuing with our decarbonization program through CO2 emission reduction plans at our industrial centers and increased plant reliability and flexibility, working to differentiate high-value products, and incorporating energy efficiency measures.
The commercial businesses will continue to optimize operations and support customers through the energy transition in a bid to make Repsol their multi-energy supplier of choice. In doing so, we will place the customer at the center of our decisions by offering them digital solutions and an end-to-end differentiated value proposition, thus bolstering our competitive position as we seek to serve society.
The Upstream segment will continue to focus on value generation through cash generation, focusing on operational efficiency and safety.
And in the corporate areas, in 2023 we will continue to work on increasing efficiency, automating processes and making the entire organization more profitable. To succeed, a Second Digital Wave will be launched in 2023 in order to

accelerate digital transformation as a key lever in the transition toward digital transformation energy and business efficiency, promoting the implementation of models, digital products and disruptive technologies. As an additional lever, the Technology strategy will allow us to have the best alliances and partners in innovative disciplines, giving support to businesses to improve their competitiveness in the medium and long term and providing agility and efficiency.
In order to accelerate the Company’s transformation by implementing the projects envisioned in the 21–25 Strategic Plan, organic investment in 2023 is expected to increase significantly compared to previous years, reaching more than €5,000 million, provided that the macroeconomic and business environment is suitably propitious.
In addition, in 2023, we will offer an attractive remuneration to our shareholders, equivalent to 25–30% of cash flow from operations. This distribution is expected to take the form of a dividend of €0.70 per share, which will be submitted for approval at the General Shareholders’ Meeting, and a reduction in capital stock.
Repsol expects that in 2023 it will be able to generate cash to finance its organic investment needs and remunerate its shareholders.

7.4 Risks The Group's main risks are identified below on a five-year horizon1, based on their importance in terms of finance, reputation and people:
Some of these risks are sensitive to the phenomenon of climate change and to the scenarios of transition to a low carbon economy, particularly those associated with regulation, future trends in demand, fluctuations in the prices of hydrocarbons, derivative products and other commodities, the potential upswing in competition, available In addition, risks related to cybersecurity are becoming talent, and adequacy of skills for the deployment of low- carbon technologies.
Given the emerging nature of the climate change risks in the current energy context, the Group is committed to extending the scope of the analysis of these risks to ensure that they are viewed on a long-term basis. This risk map is regularly
1 The Group has a methodology that, by applying common metrics, allows it to obtain an overview of the key risks, classify them according to their materiality, characterize them in an understandable and robust manner, quantify the potential economic, reputational and human impact that each business unit or corporate area may sustain, including Repsol as a whole, should it materialize, and identify, where appropriate, effective mitigation measures.

7.5 Russia's invasion of Ukraine Last year was dominated by a shift in the global economic and geopolitical situation, most notably following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Following the divestment of our assets in Russia in 2021, the Group’s exposure so far to the direct risks stemming from the war has been limited, though it has been affected by certain indirect risks arising from the new macroeconomic environment, which have pushed up commodity and product prices (see section 3. “Environment”), the tightening of trade sanctions and monetary policy, cybersecurity and the embargoes to have been imposed, among others, by the risk of regulatory changes affecting our business.
One of the biggest indirect risks to have arisen from the new macroeconomic landscape is the prevailing uncertainty regarding the supply chain, which was already stretched in 2021 due to the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation may impact the availability of certain materials and services and also push up procurement prices, thus negatively affecting the operating costs of the businesses and the cost and time objectives of ongoing investment projects. In a bid to cushion the effects of this situation, Repsol is more closely monitoring its awards to mitigate possible logistical restrictions on key materials and equipment and to adjust their supply accordingly in response to prevailing market conditions affecting suppliers and contractors.
Meanwhile, the complex economic landscape, with rampant inflation and uncertainty over the future economic recovery, could prompt the authorities to introduce temporary measures in the energy markets, or push through new legislation affecting the tax framework of the businesses.

In addition, cybersecurity risks are on the rise worldwide, threatening the confidentiality, availability and integrity of critical systems and their information. Repsol has not suffered any relevant incident or attack forcing it to activate its business continuity plans and it has continued to work alongside the competent government authorities in ensuring close monitoring and follow-up measures for this risk.
Lastly, due to the current geopolitical situation, the Group may be affected by a tightening of the sanctions and trade
European Union, its Member States, the United States, and supranational bodies such as the United Nations, on certain countries in which the Group operates and/or on related companies or individuals. l For more information on the indirect impacts of the invasion of Ukraine and the Group’s exposure to other geopolitical risks (Algeria, Libya, Venezuela or Bolivia), see Note 20.3 Geopolitical risks of the 2022 consolidated Financial Statements.

Appendix II. Alternative performance measures
Repsol’s financial information contains indicators and measures prepared in accordance with applicable financial reporting standards and regulations, as well as other measures prepared in accordance with the Group’s Reporting Model, defined as Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). APMs are measures that are “adjusted” compared to those presented in accordance with IFRS-EU or with Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Upstream Activities, and the reader should therefore consider them in addition to, but not instead of, the latter.
Repsol presents its segment performance measures including joint ventures or other companies which are jointly managed in accordance with the Group’s investment percentage, considering its operational and economic
indicators within the same perspective and degree of detail as those for companies consolidated under the full consolidation method. Thus, the Group considers that the nature of its businesses and the way in which results are analyzed for decision-making purposes is adequately reflected.
APMs are useful for users of financial information as they are for measuring inventories. It factors in purchase prices and the measures employed by Repsol’s Management to historic production costs, valuing inventory at the lower evaluate its financial performance, cash flows or financial between this cost and its market value. position when making operational or strategic decisions for the Group.
lFor more historical quarterly APM information, see www.repsol.com.
1. Financial performance measures
Adjusted net income
Adjusted net income is the key financial performance measure that Management (the Executive Committee) consults when making decisions.
Adjusted net income is calculated as net income from continuing operations at current cost of supply (or CCS) net of taxes and non-controlling interests. It excludes certain income and expenses (Special items) and the Inventory effect. Financial income is allocated to the adjusted net income of the “Corporate and others” segment.
Adjusted net income is a useful APM for investors in evaluating the performance of operating segments while

1 Cost of supplies is calculated on the basis of international quoted prices in the reference markets in which the Company operates. The relevant average monthly price is applied to each quality of distilled crude. Quoted prices are obtained from daily crude oil publications according to Platts, while freight rates are estimated by Worldscale (which publishes global reference prices for freight costs from one port to another). All other production costs (fixed and variable costs) are valued at the cost recognized in the accounts.

enabling increased comparability with Oil & Gas sector companies that use different inventory measurement methods (see the following section).
Inventory effect
For current cost of supply (CCS) earnings, the cost of volumes sold is calculated on the basis of procurement and production costs1 incurred during the period in question and not based on weighted average cost (WAC), which is the accepted methodology under European accounting law and regulations. The difference between CCS earnings and WAC earnings is included in the so-called Inventory effect, which also includes other adjustments to the valuation of inventories (write-offs, economic hedges, etc.) and is
presented net of taxes and minority interests. This Inventory effect largely affects the Industrial segment. Repsol management considers that this measurement is useful for investors, considering the significant variations arising in the prices of inventories between periods.
WAC is a generally accepted European accounting method
Special items
Significant items for which separate presentation is considered desirable to facilitate the task of monitoring the ordinary management of business operations and for comparison between periods and companies in the sector. This heading includes capital gains/losses due to divestments (capital gains and losses due to transfers or disposals of assets), restructuring costs (compensation costs...), impairments (provisions and reversals resulting from the impairment test on fixed assets, recoverability of tax credits, etc.), provisions for risks and expenses (provisions and reversals of provisions for tax, legal, environmental, geopolitical risks, etc.) and other major income or expense items outside the ordinary management of the businesses (provisions for dismantling and remediation; exchange rate impacts on fiscal positions in foreign currency; costs and compensation due to claims; sanctions and fines; valuation of financial instruments resulting from accounting asymmetries, etc.). Special items are presented net of taxes and minority interests.

EBITDA:
EBITDA, or “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization”, is a financial indicator which determines the operating margin of a company prior to deducting interest, taxes, impairment, restructuring costs, and amortization. Since it does not include financial and tax indicators or accounting expenses not involving cash outflow, it is used by Management to evaluate the company’s results over time, for a more straightforward exercise in making comparisons with peers within the Oil & Gas sector.

EBITDA is calculated as operating Income + depreciation and amortization + impairment as well as other items which do not represent cash inflows or outflows from transactions (restructuring, capital gains/losses from divestment, provisions etc.). Operating income corresponds to the result from operations at weighted average cost (WAC). Where net income from operations at current cost of supply (CCS) is used, it is known as CCS EBITDA.

2. Cash flow measurements
Cash flow from operations:
Cash flow from operations measures the generation of cash flow corresponding to operations and is calculated as: EBITDA +/- changes in working capital + collection of dividends + collection / - payment of income tax + other collections / - payments relating to operating activities. For its usefulness and to show how cash flow evolves between periods by isolating changes in current capital, Cash flow from operations can be presented excluding working capital (Cash flow from operations “ex working capital” or “OCF exWC”.
Free cash flow measures cash flow generation from operating and investment activities, and is useful for evaluating the funds available for paying shareholder dividends and servicing debt.

items) / (average capital employed for the period in operations, which measures own and external capital employed by the company, and comprises Total equity + Net debt). This includes capital employed in joint ventures or other companies managed operationally as joint ventures. If the Inventory effect is not used in the calculation process, it is known as CCS ROACE.
Cash generation is free cash flow less dividend payments, payment of remuneration for other equity instruments (coupons on perpetual bonds), transactions with non- controlling interests, net interest payments, and payments for leases and treasury shares. This APM measures the funds generated by the Company before financial transactions (mainly debt issuance and repayments).
The following is a reconciliation of the Free cash flow and Cash generated under the Group's reporting model with the consolidated statement of cash flows under IFRS-EU:

Investments may be presented as organic (acquisition of projects, assets or companies for the expansion of the Group’s activities) or inorganic (funds invested in the development or maintenance of the Group’s projects and assets). This distinction is useful in understanding how the Group’s Management allocates its resources and allows for a more reliable comparison of investment between periods.

Appendix IV. Risks Risk management
Repsol’s Integrated Risk Management System – [SGIR]
Repsol operates an Integrated Risk Management System: through coordinated action among all units involved, the key risks arising from the Group’s activities are identified, measured, managed and supervised in line with the risk policy, management systems effectively mitigate the risks to the stipulated levels. Repsol’s Integrated Risk Management System (Spanish “SGIR”) provides a reliable and advance overview of all risks to which the Company is exposed, based on a Risk Management Policy adopted by the Board of Directors. The principles of the system are embodied in an Integrated Risk Management Standard adopted by the Executive Committee.
The core pillars of the SGIR are:
• Senior Management leads integrated risk management.
• The risk perspective is integrated into management and
• Businesses and corporate areas play a role in the

• Risks are identified, assessed and addressed in
• Promotion of continuous improvement to gain efficiency
Another key element is the risk tolerance declaration, which is set out in the Risk Management Policy along with the above principles. Repsol aspires to a low-to-medium risk profile that is appropriate for an integrated and diversified energy company, differentiating between risks in which the Company is ready to accept exposure within its overall tolerance threshold, and others in which it seeks to reduce exposure to levels as low as reasonably possible. The latter type would include accident, environmental, health, safety, ethics and conduct, image and reputation and compliance risks.

Under the SGIR, the risk profile of each management unit is reported at least once a year to its senior manager for formal validation. However, the processes are prepared such that if, at any time, it is thought that the Group’s risk profile may have changed substantially due to a change in exposure to an especially significant risk, the analysis of such risks is updated.
Where appropriate, the head of the management unit sets in motion appropriate actions or control mechanisms to align the risk profile with the organization’s expectations, in line with the risk tolerance declaration set out in the Risk Management Policy. This gives the Company reasonable assurance as to compliance with the objectives of each organizational area, including operational, financial and non-financial, financial and non- financial reporting, and regulatory compliance, through internal reporting and control systems based on the principles of the COSO framework1.
The risks unit consolidates individual risk maps to obtain the consolidated Risk Map for the Repsol Group, and any partial consolidation agreed to be reported to the executive and governing bodies, which, where appropriate, issue guidelines on the treatment of certain risks, in view of the risk profile, the maturity of risk management systems and the risk tolerance declaration set out in the Risk Management Policy.
The resulting mitigation actions are driven forward by the oversight units and, when they involve management units, converge with those units’ own risk management strategies. The supervisory units include, among others, the technical functions and business specialists and the corporate functions of communication, institutional relations, finance and tax, corporate security, strategy, legal services and compliance, sustainability, finance, technology, engineering, procurement management, corporate governance, people and organizational management, digitalization and information systems, internal control and reserve control.
In the course of these activities, the risks unit collects information from the management and oversight units on their performance and expectations in relation to achieving the objectives of the SGIR. This information collection is supplemented, when appropriate, with campaigns specifically designed to obtain certain data, such as surveys or backtesting studies. By reference to this information, the area responsible for the SGIR reviews its effectiveness and ensures that the findings result in continuous improvement of the SGIR.
At all stages of the integrated risk management process, in accordance with their planning, the audit units evaluate the reasonableness and adequacy of the design and operation of the Repsol Group’s risk control and management systems, to ensure that risks are properly identified, prioritized, measured and controlled within the tolerance levels set by the Board in its Risk Management Policy, looking to prevailing standards and good industry practice. The audit units plan their engagements annually, based on the state of the risks and other considerations, with a focus on the key risks.
Integrated Management Report 2022
1 2022 Overview
1 COSO Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Repsol has an Integrated Internal Control model in place that follows the COSO framework and includes the Group’s formally developed Internal Control and Compliance Systems, most notably the System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting, the System of Internal Control Over Non-financial Reporting, and the Crime Prevention Model, among other compliance models.

5 Performance of Sustainability Outlook Appendices our businesses
The variables in the economic models on which key decision- making processes are based, such as the preparation of the annual budget and the preparation and regular updating of the strategic plan, are subject to risk analysis, and information is received from the SGIR accordingly. Going beyond single-scenario approaches, these analyses provide a probabilistic view of the achievable result by simulating multiple scenarios in which these variables, correlated to some extent or another, take different values depending on their prior statistical modeling.
System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)
The Repsol Group has a System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) whose proper functioning provides reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the Group’s financial reporting. The ICFR model is based on the methodological framework of COSO 2013 (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) as set out in their report Internal Control-Integrated Framework, which provides an integrated framework for internal control over financial reporting that is designed to ensure that transactions are recorded faithfully, in conformity with the applicable accounting framework, providing reasonable assurance in the prevention or detection of errors that might have a material impact on the information contained in consolidated financial statements. The Audit, Control and Risks department annually evaluates the design and functioning of the Group ICFR and draws conclusions on its effectiveness.
System of internal control over Non- financial Reporting (ICNFR)
The Repsol Group also has a system of Internal Control over Non-Financial Reporting (ICNFR), the aim of which is to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the non- financial information disclosed. Development of the model began following the entry into force of Spanish Law 11/2018, on non-financial information and diversity. This law requires the Group to draw up a Non-Financial Statement (NFS), which should include information relating to environmental, social and personnel-related issues, respect for human rights, the fight against corruption and bribery, and the Group’s impact on society. As with the ICFR, the ICNFR is defined on the basis of the COSO 2013 methodological framework (described in the previous section), and is there to contribute to the accurate and reliable disclosure of information, in accordance with international standards. As regards the differentiated responsibility of the units and bodies involved in risk management, the ICNFR system is based on the three-line model, which is a standard recommended by the Institute of Internal Auditors Global. The Audit, Control and Risk Management Division annually assesses the design and operation of controls, processes and other elements of the Group's ICNFR system.

Oil and gas prices, and indeed derivative prices, are subject to exogenous factors and, therefore, to volatility as a result of fluctuations in international
natural disasters, pandemics, or the energy transition process. Note that price deviations from the Group’s projected figures may be favorable or
The average price of Brent crude was $101/bbl in 2022, up 40% on the average price in 2021. Meanwhile, the average Henry Hub natural gas price stood at 6.6 $/Mbtu in 2022, well up on the average price in 2021 (3.9 $/Mbtu). The sanctions imposed due to the ongoing war in Ukraine is a determining factor in explaining the price increases, as is the increase in demand for crude oil and energy products due to the progressive recovery of economic activity and mobility, following the lifting of restrictions as the vaccination campaigns roll on.
The reduction in crude and gas oil prices adversely affects the profitability of Upstream activity, the valuation of its assets, its capacity to generate cash and its investment plans. Rising prices have the opposite effect. A potential drop in investment could adversely affect Repsol’s ability to replace its crude oil and gas reserves. For further information regarding the impact of variations (positive and negative) on the calculation of the recoverable amount of the assets that undergo an impairment test, see Note 20.1 of the 2022 consolidated financial statements.
In turn, the price of international crude oil and its derivatives may impact the value of inventories stored at the Industrial segment. In 2022, the impact of price fluctuations on inventories is reflected in the “Inventory effect” (see section 4.). The price of finished products can also affect demand for them.
Moreover, the macroeconomic environment, dependent in the short run on how the Russia-Ukraine conflict pans out, as well as by the emission reduction scenarios associated with the energy transition process and the effects of climate change, may affect the price of other commodities. There was a significant increase in 2022 in electricity prices and CO2 emission allowances (in 2022, the average wholesale electricity price rose to 167.7 €/MWh, well above the 111 €/MWh of the previous year). The former mainly impact the low-carbon generation and electricity trading businesses, while the latter affect the margins of the industrial businesses.
For more information on the prices of hydrocarbons, derivative products and other commodities in 2022, see section 3.2 of this report. For more information on the effect of prices on the earnings and performance of the businesses, see sections 4 and 5 of this report.
The energy industry is a fiercely competitive place in which to operate. This competition can be further heightened by a number of factors including the entry of new competitors, changes in market conditions, the expiration of administrative concessions, technological obsolescence or insufficient differentiation, acceleration of the energy transition process and growing levels of competition due to access to low-carbon resources. The combined effect of these factors may affect market share and margins.
affected (E&P, Refining, Mobility, Chemicals, Trading, LPG, Electricity and Gas, etc.) as this would affect business volume. These changes in demand forecasts may be caused by a broadly adverse economic climate (slowdown in economic growth in the countries to which the Group is exposed, increased unemployment, higher inflation, etc.), political climate (national or transnational conflicts or trade tensions between the major powers, etc.), or social climate (epidemiological lockdowns and restrictions, changes in consumer habits, etc.), or may be linked to climate change and energy transition scenarios. In 2021, the launch of vaccination programs across most countries and economic and fiscal stimuli were successful in pushing the economy back on course. However, it suffered a setback in 2022, due mainly to the geopolitical scenario resulting from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the context of rampant inflation. These factors may impact economic activity in the countries where the Group is present, thus reducing the demand for our products.
For more information on the impacts on activity and profitability of the businesses, see sections 4. and 5.
Disputes may arise concerning the application or interpretation of current law and regulations in certain realms.Notably, this exposure may arise in areas such as tax regulations and their interpretation, energy transition regulations, the huge array of environmental and safety regulations (environmental quality of products, air emissions, climate change and energy efficiency, extractive technologies, water discharges, soil and groundwater remediation, as well as generation, storage, transport, treatment and final disposal of waste), accounting regulations and those governing financial and non-financial information disclosed to the market, financial market regulation, competition, good corporate governance, money laundering and financing of terrorism, labor law, data protection and, in general, all those required by the public authorities. Furthermore, Repsol reports on proven oil and gas reserve estimates, a process that inherently involves a degree of uncertainty, including judgments and estimates (see Note 3.5 of the 2022 consolidated financial statements). In addition, Repsol may be affected by the existence of sanctions and trade embargo regimes adopted by the EU, its Member States, the US or other countries, as well as supranational bodies such as the United Nations, on certain countries in which it operates and/or companies or individuals based in them. For further information on the regulatory framework applicable to the Group’s main activities, see Appendix III of the 2022 consolidated financial statements and for tax-related developments, see Note 22.4.

In 2022, various regulatory and litigation risks materialized. The legislative developments to have impacted the company include the regulatory and intervention measures in the energy markets adopted by the Spanish Government due to address the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine (see Appendix III of the consolidated financial statements), the approval of extraordinary temporary levies on the profits of energy companies (see Note 22.1 to the 2022 consolidated financial statements) or the extraordinary temporary discounts on the retail prices of certain energy products, as part of the package of urgent measures enacted by the Spanish Government in response to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine (see Note 19.1. of the 2022 consolidated financial statements. With regard to financial and market risks, although in the short run the war and the sanctions imposed on Russia have made raw materials more expensive and reduced the supply of products, thus bolstering industrial margins, the conflict is instability in Libya, there were interruptions of operations at likely to encourage the acceleration of the energy transition in the Al Sharara field in order to ensure the safety of both the Europe on a longer-term horizon.

Repsol’s industrial and commercial assets (refineries, petrochemical complexes, regasification plants, power generation plants (cogeneration, combined cycle, wind farms and photovoltaic facilities), bases and warehouses, port facilities, pipelines, ships, tanker trucks, service stations, etc.) as well as Upstream installations (exploratory or production wells, surface facilities, oil platforms, etc.), both onshore and offshore, are exposed to accidents such as fires, explosions, toxic product leaks and environmental incidents with a potentially significant impact. Such accidents may cause death and injury to employees, contractors, residents in surrounding areas, as well as damage to the assets and property owned by Repsol and third parties as well as damage to the environment.
Repsol is exposed to impacts from any type of damage or temporary interruption of service associated with accidents in operations or involving vehicles for land, sea-river and air transportation of persons, substances, goods or equipment.
The Repsol Group is exposed to negative impacts arising from the management of the organization and its employees, which constitute a key asset for
such as talent attraction and retention, organizational structure, both in terms of design and dimensioning, and labor relations.
The Repsol Group is exposed to negative impacts associated with the unavailability or scarcity of market goods and services, price and cost fluctuations, as well as interruptions and deviations in time and form in the supply of goods or the provision of services, including the supply of raw materials, which may eventually force the interruption of the affected business activities. Specifically, part of the processing, transportation and marketing of crude oil and gas production from Upstream assets is carried out through infrastructure (pipelines, processing and purification units or liquefaction terminals) operated by third parties. This infrastructure is exposed to various risks, such as unscheduled shutdowns or accidents, which may affect the provision of these logistical services by the suppliers concerned. In addition, in certain countries where the Group operates that are prone to socio-political instability, there may be a shortage of qualified suppliers or contractors, which could in turn affect business. The Company is also exposed to risks arising from its relations with other firms along the supply chain, or where Repsol is held jointly liable for their actions, including non-compliances with applicable laws and other regulations, external policies and standards or administrative requirements.
It bears repeating that the new macroeconomic environment is having an impact on supply prices, which may push up business operating costs and cause deviations in the amount of planned investments. There may also be restrictions in the supply of certain critical equipment, particularly those related to low-carbon generation technologies, demand for which has risen due to the new global energy context.
In general, but especially in certain countries where it operates, Repsol is exposed to potential impacts deriving from acts of direct violence that may endanger the integrity or safety of the Company’s assets and people as a result of the actions of persons or groups motivated by any interests, whether governmental or not, including, among others, acts of terrorism, asset blockades, crime and piracy.

forward the transformation of Repsol’s industrial business in Spain in line with its commitment to becoming a zero net emissions company by 2050. The impact for the Company of these new dynamics is explained in Note 20.1 to the 2022 consolidated financial statements.
In relation to operational risks, on January 15 there was an oil spill into the sea while unloading crude oil at the La Pampilla refinery, generating an impact on the surrounding populations and the natural environment. More information on how the incident was handled can be found in sections 6.6 Safe Operation, while 6.5.3 Human rights and relations with the communities describes the grievance and redress mechanisms put in place as part of the Social Management Plan for the incident. It is also regrettable that three contractor workers died as a result of occupational accidents during 2022 (see section 6.6.1 Personal safety).

Appendix V. Additional information on Sustainability (includes Non-Financial Statement)
Repsol publishes a Management Report that combines financial and non-financial information and, specifically includes sustainability information. In its commitment to transparency and based on best practices in preparing corporate reports — particularly the recommendations contained in the “International Integrated Reporting Framework” of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC).
This appendix contains the content that makes up the non- financial information report established under Law 11/2018, of 28 December, on the disclosure of non-financial information and diversity, which are included throughout the document (in particular, in Chapter 6 – Sustainability), in this appendix and in the additional reports that make up the Management Report (Annual Corporate Governance Report and Annual Report on Directors’ Remuneration). The international framework of reference used to prepare the sustainability indicators is the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines, using the “exhaustive” option2.

Materiality [GRI3-1 alGRI3-3] and stakeholder engagement [GRI2-29]
Repsol’s relationship with stakeholders is a key aspect of the business model. That is why the Company is working to improve the process through which it establishes communication with them to identify and understand their information needs through active listening. It has tools to transparently cover these needs.
The stakeholder map is regularly updated, in collaboration with the areas of Repsol that are in direct contact with the groups. With the aim of improving communication and meeting expectations, the available channels and their effectiveness are reviewed.
The materiality analysis aims to identifying those environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues that are

The list, which is divided into 6 axes, includes sustainability- related issues with the potential to generate challenges and opportunities for both the Company and its stakeholders. To prepare it, the opinion of a panel of experts within Repsol was consulted and the specific context of the company was analyzed, as well as current and future trends in terms of sustainability.
prioritized by applying the concept of ‘double materiality’ set out in Article 1 of Directive 2014/95/EU on disclosure of non-financial information. Financial materiality is based on expert judgment and takes the Company’s risk analysis, among others, as a reference. The positive and negative impacts associated with each of the material topics are assessed, and afterwards an aggregation is carried out at the material topic level. Impact materiality is mainly determined using the results obtained after the assessment carried out through the listening channels. These results are weighted considering the stakeholder hierarchy made

into the Sustainability Strategy. The results of the materiality analysis are appraised by a committee of experts comprising risk, reputation and sustainability specialists and are then presented to the Executive Committee, which is responsible for validating them. The resulting materiality is then integrated into the Sustainability Strategy and implemented through the Global Plan and local sustainability plans. The actions envisioned in the plans, both locally and globally, are aimed at improving performance and minimizing the impact of the identified sustainability risks. This enables the Company to think strategically and take decisions to evolve the business model to ensure economic, environmental and social sustainability.

[EM-RM-410a.1] Percentage of Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) achieved through production of renewable fuels and purchase of “differentiated” Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs)
As part of the Company’s commitment to having net zero emissions by 2050, Repsol helps to reduce CO2 emissions released during transport through the use of biofuels incorporated in gasoline, kerosene and gasoil. In addition, it is focusing on the implementation in refineries and the promotion of projects of advanced biofuels (based on non- food, waste-sourced raw materials) with a strong technological content and high reduction of the carbon footprint. Work is currently under way at the Technology Lab.
To ensure the sustainability of its biofuels, Repsol has signed up to international frameworks that certify compliance with the sustainability parameters defined in the Renewables Directives (RED I and RED II) and the traceability of the raw materials employed throughout the chain of production, from their origin to the finished product. Specifically, at its industrial plants and centers, the Company's operations follow the ISCC sustainability frameworks and have been certified under the National Sustainability Verification System (SNVS). The percentage of biofuels incorporated into gasoline and diesel fuel in 2022 is higher than the minimum limits mandated by law.
It is worth noting that during 2022, biofuels manufactured using raw materials recovered from waste have been included in the portfolio, thus reducing emissions even further than is normally the case with conventional or first generation biofuels.
The total volume of biofuels incorporated into the fuels marketed by Repsol in 2022 was 1,045,361 m3 (1,077,935 m3 in 2021), of which 416,761 m3 (511,931 m3 in 2021) was produced at the Group’s refineries. The rest, 628,599 m3 (566,004 m3 in 2021),was purchased from third-party

companies and blended in the right proportion to meet gasoline and diesel specifications and our customers’ requirements. These biofuels have reduced emissions released during transport by 2.7 million tons of CO2. Repsol’s biofuel production capacity is 960,000 m3/year, divided up between BioETBE (429,000 m3/year) and hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO, 531,000 m3/year).
Likewise, in 2022 Repsol continued to promote the use of renewable fuels as a tool for the decarbonization of transport. Throughout the year, numerous agreements were established with institutions and companies for the use of renewable fuels, among which it is worth mentioning the agreements made with the Regional Transport Consortium of Madrid, Tragsa, Grupo Avanza, Grupo Sesé, New Holland, Pepsico, Geregras, and with Iberia and Air Europa in the air sector, and Navantia Seaenergies in the maritime sector.
In March 2022, it has begun the last phase of the construction of the first plant in Spain for the production of low-emission advanced biofuels at the Cartagena refinery.
The plant will have a production capacity of 250,000 tons of advanced hydrobiodiesel, and will also produce pure biojet. Placing this production on the market will prevent the emission of 900,000 tons of CO2 per year.
The construction phase is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs. The investment amount, approved in September 2020, comes to €188 million and it will become operational in the third quarter of 2023.

Repair) campaign for leak repairs as well as to partial shutdowns for operational needs.
This reduction in emissions is likewise reflected in the emissions intensity indicators referred to below.
Intensity of significant atmospheric emissions
Atmospheric emissions per ton of crude oil processed at refineries and per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) produced at E&P assets are as follows:
Refining
Tons SO2 / thousands of tons of oil processed
Tons NOx / thousands of tons of oil processed
Tons NMVOC / thousands of tons of oil processed
E&P(1)
Tons of SO2 / thousands of boe produced
Tons of NO2 / thousands of boe produced
Tons of NMVOC / thousands of boe produced
(1) The intensity indexes have been calculated on the basis of the gross production of the operated assets, as reported atmospheric emissions include 100% of emissions for such assets, irrespective of the Repsol's percentage in them.
Repsol fuels have a safety sheet and a technical sheet, where consumers can consult information on the benzene and sulfur content in gasolines and diesel fuels. This information is made available to customers and/or end consumers when requested.

[303-2/11.6.3] Management of water discharge-related impacts
Minimization of impact associated with discharges, definition of minimum criteria to ensure the quality of water returned to the environment and determination of priority substances of the effluents are mainly based on compliance with the requirements under applicable legislation in each of the locations where Repsol operates and which are included in the discharge licenses for the facilities. For example, the requirements in the European Union under the Water Framework Directive, the Industrial Emissions Directive and the Best Available Techniques Reference documents (BREF).
The E&P business has specific internal norms to ensure compliance with quality standards in discharges wherever there is no applicable local regulation, through the

Treatment of the effluents
Fluid effluents generated in the processes and activities are subjected to purification treatment to minimize their potential impact of the discharge on the environment and to ensure compliance with legal requirements. The used treatment technologies are adjusted to the type of activity and the characteristics of the facility. It may be physicochemical (primary treatment), completed with a biological process (secondary treatment), or even incorporate a more advanced treatment stage (tertiary treatment) or other specific ones for polluants that cannot be degraded by non-conventional treatments.
Main contaminants discharged The main contaminants discharged at Repsol's facilities are hydrocarbons, suspended solids, and organic matter susceptible to oxidation, measured as chemical oxygen demand (COD).

The composition of the waste managed by Repsol is divided into the categories defined in the European List of Wastes (LoW). In 2022, the Company’s main non-hazardous waste derives from construction, decommissioning and
environmental restoration activities, of which 49% have been recovered (recycled or reused). As for hazardous waste, the main waste comes from oil refining and natural gas purification activities, having recovered 7%.
In 2022, the amount of non-hazardous waste managed is reduced by 35% compared to 2021, when there was an increase due to extraordinary activities (earthwork for the

The amount of hazardous waste managed remains stable in 2022, mainly due to the extraordinary generation of waste due to the spill contingency in Peru and an increase in production and shutdowns for scheduled maintenance in Refining.
The overall waste recovery through reuse or recycling is at 35%, reducing the figure reached the previous year (62% in 2021) due to changes in the profile of the waste generated and their geographical location, which has resulted in a greater challenge for recovery.

Management of waste from drilling operations (cuttings and fluids) is controlled by the Company's internal norms known as Environmental Performance Practices (EPP). These requirements establish a set of standards that must be followed in Upstream activities and that are applicable to all geographical areas in which the company operates and regardless each country's specific legislation.
Unconventional drilling activity grew significantly at E&P North America in 2022, resulting in increased mud and cuttings wastes associated with this activity.

In 2022, restoration work was undertaken in forests, agricultural areas and meadows in 11 locations (wells and related facilities). The restoration of 24.15 ha was completed following the 2019 Alberta soil and groundwater remediation guidelines, among others. In all cases, 100% of the habitat was finally restored. All actions were approved by the competent legal authority.
In 2022, a partial restoration of 7.03 ha of gallery forest was carried out, recovering the soil on surfaces with slopes greater than 15%, and densifying the canopy coverage of the Quebrada Pelagallina forest that supplies water to the village aqueduct of Canoes La Vaga. It was carried out in accordance with environmental licensing requirements in collaboration with the local City Council, although it is still pending approval by the Colombian National Environmental Licensing Authority.
In 2022, reforestation maintenance work was carried out on 22.88 ha of peatswamp forest, which included replacing plants, fertilizing activities, and soil management. These works are a continuation of those carried out in 2021 where more than 14,300 seedlings were planted, with a density of 625 seedlings per hectare. A 96% survival rate was achieved in both years, although the target rates were 95% and 55% for 2021 and 2022, respectively. The works were carried out in areas adjacent to the Berbak Sembilang National Park, habitat of different endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Restoration was considered complete, and was approved by the Republic of Indonesia’s Ministry of Environment and Forestry.
In 2022, together with Ecoashaninka Community Organization, several actions were carried out (Construction of ridges, manual loosening of the land, direct seeding, natural regeneration, underpinning, foliar fertilization, implementation of bird perches, construction of water evacuation canals, weed control and thinning) for the partial restoration of 11.12 ha of sparse primary Pacal forest and semi-dense primary Pacal forest, on the Mapi platform and the Mashira platform. All actions were approved by the Peruvian Ministry of the Environment.
Creation of a permanent meadow by means of an agroforestry mosaic on 7 hectares of the Valdesolar photovoltaic plant, giving rise to the creation of new ecological niches to promote biodiversity, as well as the improvement of ecological connectivity around the plant.
In 2022, 23 ha were densified by planting 800 holm oaks for the regeneration of a feeding ground for cranes at the Los Berciales estate (Monterrubio de la Serena, Badajoz). It was complemented with the increase in the availability of food during the winter.
The following management measures were implemented in the Kappa photovoltaic project (Manzanares, Madrid) to improve the habitat for birdlife:
Installation of a structure for 30 nests. Installation of 3 platforms for owls.
Installation of 12 cairns (4 with owl nests).
In 2022, different measures were implemented to increase the establishment of birdlife in the surroundings of the Valdesolar photovoltaic plant. Among them, it is important to mention the installation of 25 cairns (plant/stone), two dovecotes and two multi-refuges for bats. Moreover, five naturalized water points were created at the same plant to improve habitat conditions for amphibian populations and other fauna in the project environment, for which population control has been established.

[EM-EP-160a.3] Percentage of proven and probable reserves in or near sites with protected conservation status or endangered species habitats
To prevent and mitigate impacts on biodiversity it is vital to know the species that are potentially distributed in the area of influence of the operations. Repsol uses the information provided by Proteus to determine the threatened species included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. All this information is obtained and analyzed through the IBAT tool (Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool). The following increase is not really significant. In the analysis of the table shows the number of species based on the extinction risk category and with a potential distribution in the areas of influence of the Company’s assets.

Improved knowledge of the entomofauna in the Caipipendi area, with special focus on Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera and Odonata species, given their ecological interest, their role as bioindicators, their conservation status and threats.
Biodiversity Training: 5 members from the Safety and Environment team of the Canadian Business Unit attended a course on basic principles of biodiversity management, incorporating the latest trends in its assessment (Align, BISI, TNFD, etc.) and tools and indicators for management and reporting.
Collaboration in managing the presence of the Sumatran tiger outside the restored area, which had had a deadly impact on local populations. Work was done together with local authorities and wood companies to install camera trap that made it possible to know the condition of the forest and the availability of prey for felines. A tiger footprint tracking program, as well as a reforestation area safety program, were established. No trace of any additional tigers has been found since June 2022.
Covering of a section of the Aller River canal of the La Paraya Hydroelectric Plant (Asturias) to mitigate its possible barrier effect and maintain the continuity of the habitat, reducing the risk of animals falling. Approximately 280 meters of canal have been covered.
Rescue of fish specimens from the canals of the Arenas and Camarmeña Hydroelectric Plants (Asturias). This activity is carried out annually and in the presence of rangers from the Picos de Europa National Park and the corresponding Ministries of Castilla y León and Asturias. This activity was carried out in 2022, taking advantage of the emptying of the canals to carry out maintenance activities.
Monitoring of the ecological status/potential of reservoirs and rivers downstream of the hydroelectric plants. The purpose of these campaigns is to provide monitoring so as to prevent any effects on these ecosystems that are directly related to the activity of hydroelectric energy production.
Adaptation of 1 power line identified as a conflict by the Aragón Department of Biodiversity. It involves 17 supports along 2.9 km of power lines of a 15Kv line, with the aim of reducing the accident rate of birds due to the electrocution of specimens.
Blade painting in position RO2-1 of the Romerales II wind farm (Aragón), with the aim of reducing the mortality of birds due to collisions with wind turbines.

In 2021, we reported 114 critically endangered, 287 endangered, 673 vulnerable and 742 near threatened species. In 2022, the values for this indicator increased slightly for two of the categories, due to the updating of the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species database and the inclusion of new operations within the scope of the indicator; however, this
species, we included all the operating centers of Repsol’s businesses except activities with a high geographical scattering (gas stations, for example) and activities of a temporary nature:
On the other hand, 35% (44% in 2021) of proven reserves and 19% (36% in 2021) of probable reserves operated by Repsol belong to blocks located within protected areas. The variations with respect to the 2021 figures are mainly due to a reduction in reserves located within protected areas due to changes in the portfolio of operated blocks.

There were no significant changes with respect to 2021. In the case of the manual workers in Spain, Peru and Portugal, the ratios that result from grouping the businesses with their differing salary conditions show greater differences than each to 2021 are mainly due to the company’s effort to improve company or business when analyzed separately.

The data reported include the most representative countries in terms of revenues and headcount.
The variations in remuneration measured in 2022 compared
the remuneration of its employees in all countries, the natural movements of the workforce, and the linking of remuneration to results, especially variable remuneration. Moreover, the values shown in the tables are affected by the exchange rate to euros, with a significant impact in all countries with a currency other than € (Peru, Bolivia, the
exchange rates).

(2) Includes senior management and other executives except the CEO, whose remuneration is disclosed in Note 29 to the consolidated Financial Statements, in detail and in itemized form, for both his executive and Board functions. (3) Repsol operates in Spain, Peru and Portugal in different sectors and through different corporate entities that are subject to different collective bargaining agreements, which means widely different salaries, depending on the company and the sector. Most employees in these categories are paid salaries directly determined by the relevant collective bargaining agreements, which in no case set gender-based differences in pay. A combined analysis of the pay realities of different sectors under different agreements might be misleading. The gap reflected in the table is therefore the weighted average gap of the different entities operating in these three countries. (4) To state a value that represents all employees in a country together and allows for a more representative comparison of substantially similar situations, we relied on the following factors to calculate the adjusted wage gap: business/collective bargaining agreement concerned, occupational category and employee age. This adjusted wage gap has been calculated as the weighted average ratio of women’s average pay to men’s average pay, segmented by company, occupational category and age range. Considering all the employees in these countries together, and without taking into account factors other than gender, the average pay of women compared to the average pay of men shows a gross pay gap of 0.69. (5) No ratios are given in categories with non-representative female or male workforces (fewer than three), as these are considered not statistically significant (N.S.). (-) is shown where there are no employees of either gender,

Employment framework, health and safety at work
[2-30] Collective bargaining agreements
The Group’s Framework Agreement, together with the collective bargaining agreements (eleven company collective bargaining agreements, six sectoral agreements and five company agreements), provide the basis for a framework of sustainability and trust underpinning the mutual interests of Company and employees.
As regards the legal representation of workers in Spain, in September 2022 Repsol had 802 workers’ representatives at the 15 companies included in the Framework Agreement, belonging to 10 different trade union organizations, and of whom 31 additional representatives were outside the scope of that Framework Agreement.
Of the total number of employees that make up the Repsol Group, 79.66% of the workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Repsol has employees under collective bargaining agreements in Spain, Peru, Portugal, Brazil, Indonesia, France, Italy, Mexico and Norway. In 2022, of the employees in these countries, nearly 85.22% are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The detail for each country is shown below:

(1) Although a few are governed by their individual contracts in some matters (2) In Mexico an agreement was signed with a local union that covers all local employees, however, it does not apply to expatriate staff.
It is worth noting that Repsol has other work-life balance measures in place at the Group, such as additional days of vacation or paid and unpaid leave. In Spain, for example, employees can take unpaid leave for personal reasons or additional days of paid leave and vacation time. In Canada, the law provides for various kinds of unpaid leave, though Repsol still chooses to pay the workers part of their wages while on leave. In Peru, the company provides additional leave, such as for marriage, relocation or bereavement. And in Brazil, maternity and paternity leave days have been extended. Repsol also applies minimum standards of leave worldwide to ensure a proper work-life balance. These standards are more generous than the leave provided for by law and relate to maternity, breastfeeding, paternity, marriage or death of a family member.

The risks are reassessed periodically and preventive measures are monitored.
In addition, all potential hazards at the Company's facilities are communicated to service contractors. These hazards are included in the risk assessment and measurements in relation to the work that those companies carry out on Repsol facilities.
As for chemical risks, monitoring is carried out at both European level (ECHA, REACH, etc.) and national level for all substances that might pose a risk to health, both now and in the long term, so that they can be taken into account at both exposure and design level. For this purpose, an assessment of potential exposure sites is carried out, along with a specific measurements — including those relating to design specifications — and modifications at local level if necessary.
The aim is to ensure that health risks are always below half of the limit values, both now and in the reviews normally planned over the next two to four years. Therefore, the Company ensures that these substances always below the exposure limit values or otherwise there is no exposure to them at all.

Human Rights and community relations
Risks, opportunities and due diligence
Management approach [EM-EP-210a.3] Discussion of engagement processes and due diligence practices with respect to human rights, indigenous rights and operation in areas of conflict.
In accordance with Repsol’s Human Rights and Community Relations Policy introduced in 2008, the company respects internationally recognized human rights. These rights encompass those set forth in the International Bill of Human Rights and the principles on the rights established in the International Labor Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, as well as the eight Fundamental Conventions that implement them: freedom of association (N. 87), collective bargaining (N. 98), forced labor (N. 29, N. 105), child labor (N. 138, N. 182), fair wages (N. 100) and discrimination (No. 111). Repsol mandates respect for employees’ human rights to extend compliance with this policy throughout the value chain6.
Repsol also recognizes and respects the unique nature of indigenous, tribal, aboriginal and native peoples and their rights, in accordance with current legislation and ILO Convention 169, whether or not it forms part of the legislation of a given country.
This includes rights to land, territory and resources, including the right to water; to their organization and to their social and economic structure; and to free, prior and informed consultation through appropriate procedures and, in particular, through their representative institutions, whenever legislative or administrative measures are envisaged that may affect them directly, in good faith and in a manner appropriate to the circumstances, with the purpose of seeking understanding or contributing to reaching consent on the project and the possible mitigation measures proposed
Working in a conflict zone requires the use of strategies that do not aggravate the conflict and promote peace, such as:

Repsol works to the highest human rights and security standards in all its operations, with special attention to areas of conflict. Stakeholder identification is key to human rights management, in conjunction with risk assessment and training of security contractors. Repsol is currently operating in Libya, where it leads a consortium of companies that work alongside the National Oil Company at two assets. In Libya, the Company places its human rights expertise at the disposal of the consortium and provide training to National Oil Company employees to ensure compliance with the Company’s standards.
Repsol’s goal is to build strong relationships with communities within the areas of influence of our projects and assets, based on the principles of respect, cultural sensitivity, integrity, accountability, transparency, good faith and non-discrimination. For indigenous communities, this is reflected in the signing of formal agreements to create shared value with the communities and support their sustainable development.

[EM-EP-210b.1] [RT-CH-210a.1] Discussion of process to manage risks and opportunities associated with community rights and interests
The Company has an organization, procedures and systems in place so as to reasonably manage the social, environmental, cultural and economic risks related to the management of human rights of communities in the settings in which it operates. This risk management constitutes an integral component of the Company’s decision-making, at the level of corporate governance bodies and in business management. Human rights risks are integrated with corporate management as part of the Integrated Risk Management System (SGIR in Spanish), both in the management of strategic risks (reputation and image) and operational risks (Code of Ethics and Conduct).

The due diligence processes applied by Repsol to assess impacts arising from start-up of operations are set out in Chapter 6.5.3 – Respect for human rights and community relations of this report and in the corresponding part of Appendix Vb. Further information on Sustainability (includes Non-Financial Statement) - Human Rights, as adapted to the specific rights of indigenous peoples.
The Company applies the Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment Standard (ESHIA) to ensure that environmental, social and health impacts are properly identified and mitigated. This ensures that our businesses engage in inclusive dialogue with stakeholders during the impact assessment process, provide them with relevant information and involve them in the actions to be undertaken as specified in the prevention, mitigation and monitoring plan. The reparation measures for environmental, social and health impacts consider the needs and priorities of stakeholders, and are not limited to direct monetary compensation.
In the case of the Social Management Plan for the incident at Terminal 2 of the La Pampilla refinery, a remediation phase is being developed which mainly aims to reach individual compensation agreements with groups affected by the spill. The agreements are based on the income that the affected people stopped receiving when they were unable to carry out their working activities and on the degree to which each family was affected.
The Company has different processes, procedures and practices in place to manage community interests:
• Implementation of specific socially sensitive
• Engagement with local organizations that protect
• Opening of channels for direct dialogue, such as the

Continuing with the example of Peru, in 2022 and as an action included in the Social Management Plan for the incident, a human rights impact assessment was carried out for the five districts affected by the spill: Ventanilla, Santa Rosa, Ancón, Aucallama and Chancay. As the basis of this analysis, Repsol created a social baseline from:
• A documentary analysis of public and internal
• Field work to study the affected communities and
Next, impacts on the human rights of individuals and groups in the five districts affected by the spill and the degree to which they were affected were identified. Mitigation measures and social development projects associated with the social impacts generated in the communities were defined. Impact identification and assessment and the conclusions of the study were shared with the affected communities for their knowledge, feedback and validation.
In 2022, social impact studies were also undertaken for the Jiloca and Cinca clusters (both are part of the Delta II Project) and one for all Repsol hydroelectric plants, facilities that have been operating for years in northern Spain.
Furthermore, the Eagle Ford Business Unit began working on a social impact study in preparation for the drilling activity planned for the third quarter of 2023 in Kenedy, Texas (USA).
Additional examples of environmental impact prevention and mitigation are set out in Chapter 6.2 – Environment of this report.
The Company identifies and strengthens positive impacts and shared value in regions where it is present as a result of a consensus with communities. A key tool for achieving positive impacts are social investment initiatives. Priority is given to entrepreneurship projects that empower local communities to avoid future dependency. Furthermore, the Company's activity has a positive impact through wealth creation in its sphere of influence, via local employment and supplier development.

Mandatory social investment is made pursuant to contractual obligations and is usually linked to the volume of activity carried out. In 2022, mandatory social investment increased by more than 100% compared to 2021 for different reasons. In the United States, for example, it increased mainly due to the reactivation of the drilling campaign (54 additional wells) in Marcellus (USA) and the increase in gas prices this year. In Brazil, mandatory social investment also increased significantly due to the increase in international oil and gas prices.

[GRI 11.7.4 y 11.7.5] Decommissioned sites, decommissioned structures left on site
At the end of a facility’s useful life and in accordance with applicable regulations, obligations and commitments, the Company draws up decommissioning plans to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to minimize the impact on the environment. Repsol also collaborates with the corresponding authorities to transfer the necessary responsibilities, once the Company no longer has a presence in the area. The Company has internal regulations on asset integrity and risk management, which ensure that any serious accident scenarios that may occur during decommissioning are identified and evaluated, including those that may arise from interference with assets in operation. For each scenario identified, measures are implemented that seek to preferably eliminate or minimize these dangers, and when this not possible, control and/or mitigate them, so that the risks to health and the environment are tolerable.
In 2022, 5 service stations were decommissioned in Spain (with another 4 in the process of being decommissioned), and the thermal plants in Escucha, Puertollano and Tarragona are in the process of being decommissioned.

At Block 57, we continue to implement the Ecological Restoration Plan, carried out under an agreement with the ECO- ASHÁNINKA indigenous organization at the Mapi and Mashira wells, performing revegetation monitoring work and implementing the social investment plan provided for in the exit strategy.
[EM-EP-210b.2] Number and duration of non-technical delays
In 2022, three (3) shutdowns were reported for non-technical reasons in Libya with a total delay of 60 days. The main reasons were the force majeure circumstances declared by the National Oil Company for 55 days and the 5 days of protest from one of the communities in the area of influence of the operations. The number and duration of shutdowns increased compared to 2021, when there was only 1 shutdown lasting 10 days.
Safe Operation [403-2] Hazard identification, risk assessment and incident investigation
At each stage of the life cycle of the project, asset or activity, measures are adopted that aim to understand the environment, identify hazards and analyze risks.
The risk reduction measures are defined according to the design criteria, and in the following order:
• Completely eliminate hazards.
• Replace the substances used by other less hazardous
• Decrease the amount of hazardous substances stored,
• Modify the technical and management processes in
• Isolate dangerous processes or activities, minimizing

Moreover, Repsol has Basic Safety Rules to promote a safe work environment that helps prevent situations with the greatest risk in its activities. Experts in both the methodologies and the activities analyzed participate in all hazard identification and risk management processes. There is training at both the corporate and business level available to all employees.
Psychosocial risk assessments are also carried out, using recognized methods and ensuring the anonymous, voluntary participation of all employees, which make it possible to know the psychosocial aspects (related to the structure and content of work) that can have an effect on employees’ health, as well as establish preventive measures when appropriate.
The operating sites have several programs for observing and communicating hazards and risks and unsafe conditions (for example, Planned Observation Programs) which can be reported anonymously through various tools, thus ensuring confidentiality at all times. These observations are analyzed at the corresponding levels for action.
Repsol has implemented a Stop Work Authority policy at all its centers. This policy is supported by a culture in which all employees understand their responsibility to stop an activity or task when they consider that the associated risks are not properly controlled.
Repsol has an incident management process that is summarized in the following figure, recording the entire process in the Synergi Life tool.

The most frequent injuries were dislocations, sprains, contusions, fractures and superficial injuries (cuts).
At Repsol, when analyzing an incident, all potential sources of damage or harm are identified and categorized by types of event and by “cause of injury”, in the case of personal injury. For each accident scenario, the inquiry also analyzes the specific context in which it occurred and all root causes that may have contributed to the harm, identifying technical, human or organizational shortcomings (human and organizational factors). The actions must act on all root causes identified.
In 2022, the hazards that caused high-consequence injuries belong to the categories of entrapment and blows against objects.

Responsible tax policy
GRI 207: Tax policy
Proper management of a business group’s tax obligations has a direct effect on the social and environmental areas, since payment of taxes in accordance with the current legal framework has a major impact on countries’ development and progress.
Moreover, transparency on tax strategy and policy has recently gained immense significance among stakeholders. Aware of this challenge, Repsol has embraced the most rigorous international standards when it comes to tax disclosure, including those under GRI 207.

responsibly in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of tax regulations, and are aligned with the economic activity of the various businesses. The tax function is present in the Group’s business decisions to ensure that they are in line with the principles of its Tax Policy and with the economic reality and motivation of its businesses. Hence there are internal regulations and procedures (rules on investments, related-party transactions, etc.) that ensure the adoption of tax positions based on sound economic or business grounds (avoiding abusive tax planning schemes or practices), avoidance of opaque or artificial corporate structures to hide or reduce the transparency of activities, and application of the principle of open competition in intra-group transactions.

For further information on how the tax approach is integrated into Repsol’s organization, see https:// www.repsol.com/es/sostenibilidad/fiscalidad-responsable/marco-control-fiscal/index.cshtml Integration of the tax approach at Repsol is governed by an orderly compliance management model comprising policies, rules (general and specific), internal procedures and controls, and standardized processes, all of which are subject to the guidelines of the Code of Ethics and Conduct, aimed at mitigating the key tax risks. Repsol’s tax department is made up of experts in a range of tax-related disciplines; these professionals are responsible for managing all the tax affairs of the businesses and areas of the Group. Reporting solely to the Corporate Financial and Tax department (DCEF), the tax units of each country and/or business handle tax management on a decentralized basis in order to suitably address the specifics of each business and tax system. The continuity of strategy implementation and tax management in the face of unforeseen events is underpinned by a contingency plan that ensures suitable succession in key tax-management positions. The Group’s tax experts are subject to the same remuneration and incentive policy as the rest of the Company’s employees, and receive a comprehensive and continuous training plan, updated annually, which allows them to strengthen and complete their professional skills and renew their commitments to comply with the obligations derived from the Code of Ethics and Conduct.
Tax risk management at Repsol is embedded in the global policy of the Integrated Risk Management System (SGIR in Spanish) and is reflected in the existence of processes, systems and internal controls (ICFR, Compliance Plan, key controls, etc.). A cornerstone of the SGIR is the concern to maintain a risk profile that is aligned with a medium- low risk tolerance, typical of a global and integrated multi-energy company business model that is present throughout the value chain. The Corporate Financial and Tax department (DCEF) is responsible for managing the Group’s tax risks, as the body responsible for tax compliance. In the context of the SGIR, the DCEF monitors tax risks through preparation and updating of a risk map, which comprises identification, analysis, valuation, verification and reporting stages. To mitigate tax compliance risks, Repsol has implemented standardized and documented processes that regulate essential aspects of tax compliance. These processes identify the people and areas responsible for each phase of tax management and specify all activities to be carried out for the preparation of tax returns and self-assessments. Tax management processes must, therefore, ensure the reliability and traceability of the information and establish a suitable level of prior reviews. In addition, Repsol operates robust information management systems that assure the integrity of the information and tax compliance processes while minimizing the possibility of human error.

Hence, Repsol performs a self-assessment of its tax control framework by comparing it to the highest standards in tax governance, including the B-Team responsible tax principles, which have been compared to another B-Team company in a peer-review process, the requirements under GRI 207 and the OECD model for controlling tax risks, among others. The alignment of the tax control framework to international best practices in tax compliance is verified and tested by independent experts. According to the evaluation of these experts, Repsol’s tax control framework achieves a high level of convergence and compliance with the criteria set out in international standards and the requirements of the UNE 19602 – Tax Compliance standard. Finally, as mentioned earlier, the Board is informed of the implementation of the Group’s tax policy and strategy. For further information, see the Good Tax Practices Self-Assessment report available at https://www.repsol.com/ es/sostenibilidad/fiscalidad-responsable/estrategia-fiscal/index.cshtml
system and maintaining cooperative relations with the tax authorities of the countries where it operates, based on mutual respect, transparency and trust. To this end, it cooperates with tax authorities in the detection and search for solutions to fraudulent tax practices, facilitates access to information and prioritizes non-litigious channels for dispute resolution. This approach encompasses adherence to cooperation agreements and active audits in real time. Key examples of Repsol’s initiatives in the field of cooperative relations include: (i) voluntary adherence in Spain to the Code of Good Tax Practices, and presentation, since 2015, of the Voluntary Tax Transparency Report; (ii) Repsol’s qualification as an authorized economic operator in the European Union and Peru, in recognition of its status as a reliable operator in the field of customs procedures; (iii) involvement in the EU’s ETACA pilot program aimed at facilitating tax compliance by companies on the basis of a relationship of greater cooperation, transparency and mutual trust in line with the OECD’s ICAP initiative (coordinated verification by the tax authorities of different countries that assess tax risks, including transfer pricing) and, as a result, classification of Repsol as an entity with a low risk of non-compliance by the tax authorities participating in the initiative; and (iv) strengthening cooperative relations with the Canada Revenue Agency, the CONFIA program in Brazil and through similar formulas to the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) in the United States.
Many of the laws and regulations on tax transparency and fiscal responsibility currently in force arose from the debates and forums of international organizations (UN, OECD, EU, etc.). Hence at Repsol we support institutional relations with these authorities and other stakeholders to align the Company’s tax policies with social reality, contribute responsibly to the creation of a fairer and more balanced international tax framework, and enable anticipation in tax management in the face of any regulatory changes to minimize their risks and impacts. An example of this is Repsol’s involvement, sometimes on its own behalf, in the public information regularly issued by various international organizations such as the OECD, the EU or the Platform for Collaboration in Tax Matters (UN, OECD, IMF and World Bank). Through engagement in these discussions (usually at the invitation of the corresponding organization), Repsol has had the opportunity to present its views on key issues in the current environment, such as the global minimum tax (OECD and EU), European legislation on energy taxation or the carbon border adjustment, among other regulatory projects. Repsol is a member of several of the subcommittees created by the UN's Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, which discuss and draw up tax guides for the authorities in developing countries. Repsol is also a member of the Tax Committee of Business at OECD (formerly known as BIAC) and holds the position of vice-chair of the Tax Commission of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).

Stakeholder response to these initiatives has been positive. Thus, organizations of renowned international prestige, such as Norges Bank, the Observatory on Corporate Social Responsibility, Transparency International Spain, OXFAM, Fundación Haz and the prize awarded at the end of 2022 by VBDO in recognition of the most tax- transparent company among those in the EU, have confirmed the high degree of compliance by Repsol with the accountability commitments undertaken in its Tax Policy.
The latest published report provides the 2021 data, as presented to the Spanish tax authorities in 2022 for automatic sharing with other tax authorities. The publication of this report represents advance compliance with European legislation (Directive (EU) 2021/2101) by Repsol. The report includes additional information to aid an understanding of Repsol’s presence, performance and tax contribution in each country, which exceeds the scope of the Directive. The data included in the country-by-country report follow the OECD standards.

In 29 evaluations, corresponding to 17 suppliers, the environmental performance score was below 5 out of 10 (compared with 12 assessments on 10 suppliers in 2021). Negative scores are related to logistics contracts and equipment installation, cleaning, business services and maintenance, among others. As in 2021, after these negative assessments, improvements were agreed with 100% of the suppliers affected. We have not terminated any supplier relationship for environmental reasons.

[414-2] Negative social impacts in the supply chain and measures taken
We conducted 3,702 assessments (3,010 in 2021) on social issues regarding 878 suppliers (1,125 in 2021). We found 112 assessments (41 in 2021) corresponding to 46 suppliers (30 in 2021) with a performance score in social aspects below 5 out of 10. As in 2021, negative assessments largely concerned the Code of Ethics and Conduct and human rights aspects. As in the previous year, after these negative assessments, improvements were agreed with 100% of the
suppliers. As in 2021, no supplier relationships were terminated due to social concerns (e.g., human rights or labor issues).
Responsible customer management
[RT-CH-410b.2] Strategy to (1) manage hazardous chemicals and (2) develop alternatives with reduced human or environmental impact
Repsol has internal rules in the field of safe product management that lay down the requirements to ensure suitable handling of the risks at each stage in the life cycle of a product, from design to placement on the market. The Chemicals business has implemented these requirements through a procedure whereby:
• During product design, it is necessary to study potential
• During procurement of raw materials and additives,
• During operations, by means of the inherently safe
• When products are placed on the market, customers
The procedure is supported by a new digital tool used to manage the safety documents of products supplied, manufactured and sold from a single point quickly and easily.
Current legislation is often what determines product hazardousness and it is crucial to monitor regulatory changes. Repsol has tools with which it continuously monitors changes to legislation. Once a change that impacts the product portfolio is detected, said impact is assessed and possible actions are decided.

At the Polyolefins business, several key projects are underway to replace substances that could be a concern for humans and the environment. Phthalates, coming from the catalytic system, have been removed from the entire range of food applications and only remain in some grades intended for extra-high impact technical parts, and not food. To remove it from these grades, alternatives are being sought in a pilot plant.
In the field of food safety, we seek to identify and replace substances in food contact materials that migrate into food at a threshold rate. A range of plant stearates has already been assessed and approved, and they have been changed in

Several lines of work are also underway in this field to assess the behavior of materials and reduce the impact on health and the environment: generation and content of NIAS (Non-Intentionally Added Substances), organic volatiles, products generated by secondary reactions in the reactor, etc.
Furthermore, we have also approved a new additive in the process to replace the current one in which we have detected properties that are harmful for human health.
Work has already been carried out in one of the two plants that used it, which has allowed it to be replaced. The necessary works in the second plant are expected to be completed before the end of 2022.

e) Sustainable Finance Taxonomy
On June 18, 2020, the European Parliament enacted Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (framework also known as Sustainable Finance Taxonomy1) as an instrument to reach the goal of achieving a climate-neutral European Union in 2050.
This taxonomy, which came into force in 2021, establishes a series of economic activities ("eligible" activities) that are included in 13 macro-sectors.
However, for an activity classified as "eligible" to be considered as environmentally sustainable because it is “aligned” to the taxonomy, it must make a substantial contribution to at least one of the environmental objectives defined to date by the EU2 (climate change mitigation and adaptation), it must not significantly harm the other environmental objectives (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems), and it must also comply with a minimum number of social safeguards.
Repsol has defined a work process involving all the Company's businesses, thus enabling it to carry out the exercise of classifying its activities as "eligible" or "aligned" in accordance with the criteria set out in the European taxonomy (see the next section, "Alignment determination process"). To accomplish this, multidisciplinary technical teams have been set up to determine what activities could be • Activities that must exceed an established threshold of GHG classified as "eligible" or "aligned." Once the classification for each activity was established, the economic teams obtained the information from the economic indicators (KPI for turnover, capex, and opex3) defined by the Delegated Regulation, whose amounts were extracted from the economic-financial systems of each business. In the last stage of consolidation and review, the proportion of each indicator on the IFRS-EU consolidated magnitude was calculated, ensuring the integrity and sole allocation of the economic indicators reported in accordance with the breakdown criteria defined.4
This information is reached by the System of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR) and non-financial ICnFR (see Appendix IV), as well as the verification of the external auditor (PwC).
Integrated Management Report 2022
1 2022 Overview
1 In conjunction with the Delegated Regulations implementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 relating to technical and economic requirements. 2 Pending the rest of the objectives development: (i) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, (ii) transition to a circular economy, (iii) pollution prevention and control, and (iv) protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. 3 Turnover: "sales" and "income from services rendered and other income" headings of the IFRS-EU profit and loss account. Capex: movements in operating investments for the period (organic or through business combinations) under the headings "tangible fixed assets" and "intangible fixed assets" on the IFRS-EU balance sheet. Opex: this is calculated with the expenses needed to guarantee the continuous and efficient operation of the assets included in the subheadings "maintenance and conservation" (which includes expenses incurred in building renovation measures), "leasing expenses," and "research and development expenses" of the heading "other operating income/expenses" of the IFRS-EU profit and loss account. 4 Criteria established by Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214.

Alignment determination process The process of determining the alignment of the activities identified as "eligible" by the Sustainable Finance Taxonomy starts with the verification of compliance with the criteria of having a substantial contribution to the mitigation of climate change (see the table on the next page). Once the activities that meet the requirements are identified, compliance with the criteria of not causing significant harm (hereinafter, "DNSH") is validated with respect to the different environmental objectives (adaptation to climate change, water resources, pollution, circular economy, and biodiversity). Finally, the appropriate checks are carried out to determine that Repsol complies with the so-called “minimum safeguards” (OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the International Bill of Human Rights).
Compliance with the criterion of making a substantial contribution to the mitigation of climate change
The Taxonomy establishes different types of substantial contribution criteria. Thus, the activities identified by Repsol can be classified as follows (which are specific for each activity):

In view of the previous templates, in 2022, eligible turnover amounted to €5,825 million (8%), of which €267 million (0.4%) was considered environmentally sustainable according to the Taxonomy. This was mainly to turnover from the generation and storage of energy from renewable sources. The income eligibility KPI for the year 2021 was 10%. The inter-annual variation is explained by the increase on the non elegible business (Upstream and Refining), offset by the turnover of the activities related to fossil gas (non elegible activities in 2021).
In 2022, eligible capex amounted to €1,149 million (30%), of which €816 million (21%) was considered environmentally sustainable according to the Taxonomy. Likewise, the capex eligibility KPI for the year 2021 was 28%; which is in line with the amount from the year 2022.
Lastly, in 2022, eligible opex amounted to €94 million (19%), of which €8 million (2%) was considered environmentally sustainable according to the Taxonomy. The eligibility percentage remains in line with that of last year, which was 18%.
Other relevant information Repsol through joint ventures consolidated by the equity method in the Group's financial statements (see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), additionally participates in the following activities:

Repsol, S.A. and investees comprising the Repsol Group
Independent verification report Statement of Non-Financial Information 31 December 2022

==Page <Page:228>==

To the shareholders of Repsol, S.A.:
Pursuant to article 49 of the Code of Commerce, we have verified, with the scope of a limited assurance engagement, the Consolidated Statement of Non-Financial Information (“SNFI”) for the year ended 31 December 2022 of Repsol, S.A. (Parent company) and subsidiaries (hereinafter "Repsol" or the Group) which forms part of the accompanying Repsol’s Consolidated Management Report attached.
The content of the consolidated management report includes information additional to that required by current mercantile legislation in relation to non-financial information, which has not been covered by our verification work. In this respect, our work was limited solely to verifying the information identified in tables: c) "GRI Index" and d) "Statement of non-financial information" of Appendix V. "Additional information on Sustainability (includes Non-Financial Statement)" included in the accompanying Consolidated Management Report.
Responsibility of the directors of the Parent company
The preparation of the SNFI included in Repsol's consolidated management report and the content thereof, are the responsibility of the directors of Repsol, S.A. The SNFI has been drawn up in accordance with the provisions of current mercantile legislation and in accordance with the criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI Standards”) and Oil & Gas Industry Supplement as per the details provided for each matter in the tables: c) "GRI Index" and d)"Statement of non-financial information" of Appendix V. "Additional information on Sustainability (includes Non-Financial Statement)" of the Consolidated Management Report.
This responsibility also includes the design, implementation and maintenance of the internal control considered necessary to allow the SNFI to be free of material misstatement due to fraud or error.
The directors of Repsol, S.A. are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information required to prepare the SNFI is obtained.
Our independence and quality management
We have complied with the independence requirements and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (“IESBA Code”) which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

==Page <Page:229>==

Our firm applies current international quality standards and maintains, consequently, a quality system that includes policies and procedures related to compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory provisions.
The engagement team consisted of professionals specialising in non-financial information reviews, specifically in information on economic, social and environmental performance.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in a limited assurance independent report based on the work we have performed. We carried out our work in accordance with the requirements laid down in the current International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (ISAE 3000 Revised) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and in the Guidelines for verification engagements of the Statement of Non-Financial Information issued by the Spanish Institute of Auditors (“Instituto de Censores Jurados de Cuentas de España”).
In a limited assurance engagement, the procedures performed vary in nature and timing of execution, and are less extensive, than those carried out in a reasonable assurance engagement and accordingly, the assurance provided is also lower.
Our work consisted of posing questions to management as well as to the various units of Repsol that were involved in the preparation of the SNFI, of the review of the processes for compiling and validating the information presented in the SNFI, and in the application of certain analytical procedures and review procedures on a sample basis, as described below:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Meetings with the Repsol, S.A. personnel to understand the business model, policies and management approaches applied, principal risks relating to these matters and to obtain the information required for the external review.

"Additional information on Sustainability (includes Non-Financial Statement)" of the Consolidated Management Report, taking into account the content required by current mercantile legislation.
Analysis of the procedures used to compile and validate the information presented in the SNFI for the year 2022.

Conclusion
Based on the procedures performed in our verification and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the SNFI of Repsol, S.A. and its subsidiaries, for the year ended 31 December 2022 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the provisions of current mercantile legislation and in accordance with the criteria of GRI and Oil & Gas as per the details provided for each matter in the tables: c) "GRI Index" and d) "Statement of non-financial information" of Appendix V. "Additional information on Sustainability (includes Non- Financial Statement)" of the consolidated management report.
Emphasis of matter
The Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 relating to the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investments establishes the obligation to disclose information on the manner and extent to which the company's activities are associated with economic activities aligned in relation to the objectives of climate change mitigation and adaptation to climate change for the first time for the year 2022, in addition to the information referring to eligible activities required in the year 2021. Consequently, comparative alignment information has not been included in the accompanying SNFI. On the other hand, to the extent that the information referring to eligible activities in the year 2021 was not required with the same level of detail as in the year 2022, detailed information regarding eligibility is not strictly comparable either in the accompanying SNFI.
Additionally, it should be noted that Repsol's directors have incorporated information on the criteria that, in their opinion, best allow compliance with the aforementioned obligations and that are defined in note e) "Sustainable Finance Taxonomy" of Appendix V. "Additional information on Sustainability (Includes Non-Financial Statement)" of the accompanying SNFI. Our conclusion has not been modified in relation to this matter.
Use and distribution
This report has been drawn up in response to the requirement established in current Spanish mercantile legislation and therefore may not be suitable for other purposes and jurisdictions.
